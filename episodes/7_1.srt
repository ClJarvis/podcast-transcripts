00:00:07,059 --> 00:00:11,994
Bekah: Hello and welcome back to
the Virtual Coffee Podcast. I am

2
00:00:12,144 --> 00:00:15,535
Bekah, and this is a podcast that
features members of the Virtual

3
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:18,835
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee
is an intimate group of

4
00:00:18,835 --> 00:00:21,774
developers at all stages of their
coding journey, and they're here

5
00:00:21,804 --> 00:00:25,254
on this podcast sharing their
stories and what they've learned.

6
00:00:25,448 --> 00:00:28,182
Here with me today is my co-host,
Dan

7
00:00:28,527 --> 00:00:31,338
Dan: What up, Bek? How's it
going? We're back!

8
00:00:31,527 --> 00:00:35,143
Bekah: We are back. We are back
for this brand new season of the

9
00:00:35,143 --> 00:00:38,023
Virtual Coffee Podcast season
seven.

10
00:00:38,137 --> 00:00:43,963
Dan: Season seven. Can you
believe it? I think we're, uh, I

11
00:00:43,963 --> 00:00:45,883
don't know when we're supposed to
come out with this, but we took a

12
00:00:45,883 --> 00:00:49,603
little break, but I'm really
excited to get, get going again.

13
00:00:49,607 --> 00:00:53,173
It, it, we've recorded a couple
already and, uh, it's been really

14
00:00:53,173 --> 00:00:56,829
nice and really fun. I, I missed
it, so I'm, I'm happy to be back.

15
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:00,130
Bekah: Well, I'm really excited
to be back too. We have some

16
00:01:00,369 --> 00:01:03,700
awesome guests this season. Some
new friends, some friends who

17
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,370
have been around for a while.
What are we talking about this

18
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:07,269
season, Dan?

19
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:11,049
Dan: We're talking about becoming
a founder. We're talking about

20
00:01:11,049 --> 00:01:15,250
like some technical writing
stuff. We have, uh, already had a

21
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:20,019
couple discussions about neuro
neurodiversity in tech, uh, which

22
00:01:20,019 --> 00:01:23,019
is obviously you've, if you're a
long time listener, you know,

23
00:01:23,019 --> 00:01:27,125
that's kind of a, kind of a good
topic for us to talk about. What

24
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:28,924
else are we talking about? This,
this season? We got a

25
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:32,090
Bekah: Career transitions. We're
always fan of career transitions.

26
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,159
Lots of new origin stories.

27
00:01:34,674 --> 00:01:37,584
Dan: Origin stories are almost
the best. I mean, all really, all

28
00:01:37,584 --> 00:01:39,984
of it is the best part, but I, I
love hearing people's origin

29
00:01:39,984 --> 00:01:44,655
stories so much. And I'd say at
least like 50, 60% of our guests

30
00:01:44,674 --> 00:01:48,734
say, oh, I just have a boring
origin story, you know? And then

31
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:51,765
they like, tell us and it's never
boring, And it's always, it's

32
00:01:51,765 --> 00:01:56,000
always. Very, I dunno, unique and
interesting. I, I, I find them

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,870
endlessly fascinating.

34
00:01:57,319 --> 00:02:00,200
Bekah: Yeah, I think it doesn't
matter what your origin story is,

35
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:03,109
even if it, you have taken like a
quote unquote traditional route

36
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:07,370
into tech. I always enjoy hearing
how people got here and what

37
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:11,960
they've done to, you know, oh,
they with technology as a child,

38
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:14,840
or they hated technology as a
child. I don't know. It's just

39
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:18,229
fun to see the different paths
that lead people to where they

40
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:18,710
are today.

41
00:02:19,115 --> 00:02:21,634
Dan: Yeah, absolutely. And
honestly, I don't even know these

42
00:02:21,634 --> 00:02:26,375
days what you, what even is a
traditional path into tech, you

43
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:30,754
know? Uh, everything has changed
so much. I mean, maybe co maybe

44
00:02:30,754 --> 00:02:35,044
college and computer science and
stuff, or, but like that's I've

45
00:02:35,044 --> 00:02:37,594
dug in on the, the people that
have gone through like college.

46
00:02:37,594 --> 00:02:42,305
College. I. I've, I've, I mean, I
always find it very fascinating.

47
00:02:42,305 --> 00:02:48,705
So yeah, our first guest this
season is, uh, is Jörn Bernhardt,

48
00:02:48,705 --> 00:02:53,474
and he is from Germany and he's
been a member for a while. He,

49
00:02:53,564 --> 00:02:57,224
uh, Virtual Coffee and, um, he's
really great guy. I, I, I've

50
00:02:57,224 --> 00:02:59,895
always enjoyed hanging out with
him. He's come on to TypeScript

51
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:04,215
Tuesdays a few times. Um, and he
recently actually just started a

52
00:03:04,215 --> 00:03:08,085
new Coffee Table group in Virtual
Coffee that's doing CSS battles

53
00:03:08,264 --> 00:03:09,044
on Fridays.

54
00:03:09,675 --> 00:03:13,425
Bekah: have to announce it at
Virtual Coffee every Tuesday, and

55
00:03:13,425 --> 00:03:16,784
it has a really hard title. What

56
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:19,919
Dan: Oh yeah. Uh, he, he likes
alliteration. He's a big fan of

57
00:03:19,925 --> 00:03:20,550
that. So,

58
00:03:20,985 --> 00:03:25,064
Bekah: Yeah, it is Front End
Friday Folks Fighting

59
00:03:25,064 --> 00:03:28,284
CSSBattle.dev.

60
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:31,889
Dan: Yeah. Uh, that was like the
fourth one he sent to me. He sent

61
00:03:31,889 --> 00:03:34,830
me a bunch of titles, so he
worked really hard on that one.

62
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,455
Um, so. We had a really great
time talking to Jörn, um, on the

63
00:03:40,455 --> 00:03:43,694
podcast. He has a, again, a, a
really interesting story and he's

64
00:03:43,694 --> 00:03:47,354
had a very interesting career
too, um, which I enjoyed hearing

65
00:03:47,354 --> 00:03:52,145
about. He's a two-time founder
and he does a lot of work with

66
00:03:52,474 --> 00:03:56,645
governments, which that's like a
whole world that I know nothing

67
00:03:56,645 --> 00:04:00,514
about. Um, and it was really cool
hearing Jörn how he's working

68
00:04:00,564 --> 00:04:04,224
with government stuff and still
doing his own thing cuz he is

69
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:06,525
independent. He is not an
employee of a government, but his

70
00:04:06,525 --> 00:04:10,349
company, does contracting with,
uh, with governments and I dunno,

71
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,152
I found that, I found that very
interesting. It was a good time

72
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:17,783
talking to Jörn and I know you
all are gonna enjoy it.

73
00:04:18,653 --> 00:04:21,502
Bekah: We start every episode of
the podcast, like we start every

74
00:04:21,502 --> 00:04:24,892
Virtual Coffee. We introduce
ourselves with our name, where

75
00:04:24,892 --> 00:04:29,333
we're from, what we do, and a
random check-in question. Today's

76
00:04:29,783 --> 00:04:41,315
question is, what's your favorite
science fiction story? My name is

77
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:46,511
Bekah. I am a technical community
builder from a small town in

78
00:04:46,511 --> 00:04:51,550
Ohio, and my favorite science
fiction story is Kindred by

79
00:04:51,961 --> 00:04:55,961
Octavia Butler, which is now a
mini-series. And I haven't seen

80
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:59,620
it because it's my favorite book
and I'm too nervous to watch it

81
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,961
because if they don't do it
right, I'm gonna be really angry.

82
00:05:03,675 --> 00:05:05,555
Dan: what happens in Kindred? I
feel like I've read that.

83
00:05:06,011 --> 00:05:11,711
Bekah: So it is a slave narrative
time travel story.

84
00:05:12,526 --> 00:05:14,706
Dan: Are there more than, is it a
series of books?

85
00:05:15,086 --> 00:05:18,386
Bekah: no, but you know what
Parable of the Sower, I think is

86
00:05:18,386 --> 00:05:22,225
by Octavia Butler, and we did
that for Virtual Coffee Book Club

87
00:05:22,615 --> 00:05:23,636
a long time ago.

88
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,321
Dan: Okay. I definitely read that
one.

89
00:05:26,846 --> 00:05:27,295
Bekah: Yeah.

90
00:05:27,581 --> 00:05:29,170
Dan: That's cool. Octavia Butler
is dope.

91
00:05:29,605 --> 00:05:30,086
Bekah: Yeah.

92
00:05:30,911 --> 00:05:35,620
Dan: cool. Hi, I am Dan. I live
in Cleveland. I do things on

93
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:40,151
computers, and uh, um, yeah, I
don't know. I mean, the first

94
00:05:40,151 --> 00:05:42,940
thing that pops in my mind is
Star Wars. Um, there are some.

95
00:05:45,326 --> 00:05:48,505
People will, might argue that
it's not sci-fi cuz of reasons,

96
00:05:48,505 --> 00:05:51,026
you know, so I understand that.
Uh, if I had to pick a second

97
00:05:51,026 --> 00:05:54,086
one, um, I don't know, because my
mind usually goes blank for these

98
00:05:54,086 --> 00:05:59,396
kinds of questions. Um, I think
the, I I would say if, if we had

99
00:05:59,396 --> 00:06:01,795
to, like, if we're gonna be
strict with the science fiction,

100
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:07,586
you know, whatever. Um, the
Expanse series was amazing, very,

101
00:06:07,586 --> 00:06:10,286
very long, but very, very, very
good. Um, so

102
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,161
Bekah: That's a TV show too,
right?

103
00:06:12,326 --> 00:06:14,665
Dan: Yeah, they made a TV show of
it. I, I watched a little bit of

104
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:17,545
it, it was fine. Um, I don't
know, I don't know if they've

105
00:06:17,665 --> 00:06:21,685
finished the whole thing or, or
not. I, my Emily was not that

106
00:06:21,685 --> 00:06:24,266
interested in it and so we just,
you know, I don't watch a lot of

107
00:06:24,266 --> 00:06:28,045
TV by myself, so it just kind of
fell off the wayside. But the

108
00:06:28,045 --> 00:06:31,826
books are, are, are so good. Um,
so that would be, uh, yeah,

109
00:06:31,826 --> 00:06:34,255
that'd be my answer. Star Wars
First Expanse second.

110
00:06:35,168 --> 00:06:41,809
Jörn: Okay. Hi, I'm Jörn. I, uh,
work at compose.us and, um, I

111
00:06:41,838 --> 00:06:45,348
work as a web developer and doing
all sorts of stuff because I'm

112
00:06:45,348 --> 00:06:49,399
also the founder of that company.
And, uh, At another company

113
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:56,778
before. And yeah, always web
related programming stuff. Um, my

114
00:06:56,778 --> 00:07:01,668
favorite science fiction movie, I
think I have to copy Dan because

115
00:07:01,749 --> 00:07:07,579
I, I don't really know. Um, like
I, I love watching, um, science

116
00:07:07,579 --> 00:07:12,769
fiction and fantasy movies and,
um, like everything there, but

117
00:07:13,369 --> 00:07:18,574
Star Wars was also the first
thing on my mind because, it was

118
00:07:19,093 --> 00:07:22,903
the, uh, childhood experience, I
guess.

119
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:24,379
Dan: Yeah,

120
00:07:24,834 --> 00:07:25,324
Jörn: Yeah.

121
00:07:25,788 --> 00:07:26,418
Dan: exactly.

122
00:07:28,413 --> 00:07:30,903
Bekah: Well, that's awesome.
Welcome Jörn. We are happy to

123
00:07:30,903 --> 00:07:35,613
have you here with us and we
always like to get started with

124
00:07:35,613 --> 00:07:39,334
your origin story and we're gonna
do things slightly different this

125
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:44,793
season. Um, we're gonna start
with one word. that describes

126
00:07:44,853 --> 00:07:49,653
your tech journey. And then, then
I'm gonna have you tell us a

127
00:07:49,653 --> 00:07:52,084
little bit more about how you got
to where you are. So what's your

128
00:07:52,084 --> 00:07:52,684
one word?

129
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:57,978
Jörn: Um, well, it's, uh, I, I
guess dream job. There's just

130
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:03,348
technically two words, but yeah,
I, I have to admit that, um, I

131
00:08:03,348 --> 00:08:09,769
actually always wanted to be a,
um, like with programming and,

132
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:14,418
um, my, my really first dream job
wasn't like policemen or,

133
00:08:15,769 --> 00:08:19,009
astronaut or something, but it
was actually video game tester

134
00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:24,199
because I played video games like
Alley Cat as a, as a

135
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:29,538
three-year-old. So I wanted to,
to, um, play these games all the

136
00:08:29,538 --> 00:08:34,038
time. And then I figured out
really, really fast that I wanted

137
00:08:34,038 --> 00:08:38,509
to create my own game, so video
game programmer, so I could test

138
00:08:38,509 --> 00:08:43,879
them and create them. that's way
more awesome. So my whole life

139
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:48,469
was more like, okay, how do I
program, how does that work? And

140
00:08:49,099 --> 00:08:54,288
somehow out of that I got way
more interested into programming

141
00:08:54,288 --> 00:08:58,519
itself, what you can do with it.
And uh, it led me to a lot of

142
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:03,438
different things. And now I'm
trying to create nice experiences

143
00:09:03,438 --> 00:09:08,854
for people and, uh, yeah,
especially on the web cause. Have

144
00:09:08,884 --> 00:09:10,653
like the biggest audience, I
guess.

145
00:09:12,573 --> 00:09:14,464
Bekah: what was your learning
experience like?

146
00:09:15,663 --> 00:09:20,884
Jörn: So, um, yeah, it, it wasn't
really nice because nobody really

147
00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:24,994
could help me with, uh,
programming. So my parents, well,

148
00:09:24,994 --> 00:09:28,264
they had the computer obviously,
but, um, they didn't program

149
00:09:28,264 --> 00:09:36,499
themselves. And, um, my, my uncle
gave me like a big box of. Of

150
00:09:36,798 --> 00:09:41,688
floppy disks and I tested all of
them out and tried things like,

151
00:09:41,719 --> 00:09:45,859
okay, how does this work? How
does that work? Got a manual for

152
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:50,479
MS. Dos so I could write my own
text adventure. That was like my

153
00:09:50,479 --> 00:09:55,639
very first thing that I did. And
the text adventure worked by use

154
00:09:56,068 --> 00:10:02,208
CD into different folders where
you then could read like the next

155
00:10:02,214 --> 00:10:08,119
part of the story, which was.
Weird. I think at that time as a,

156
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:16,519
as a boy, and, um, later, I, I
had in school, um, some vet

157
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:21,739
development, well, not really
course, but there, there was an

158
00:10:21,744 --> 00:10:29,629
art teacher who, um, created like
a website and, um, made me look

159
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:36,109
into that and how that works.
Then we used Macromedia, um,

160
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:39,558
director, which is like the
predecessor of Flash, I think.

161
00:10:40,729 --> 00:10:48,589
And um, there we created things
like, uh, little games for, uh,

162
00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:53,688
CD ROM for the school that they,
that they put out there, um,

163
00:10:53,688 --> 00:10:58,399
which was refund to, to work on
these kind of things. I then got

164
00:10:58,403 --> 00:11:05,583
a manual for C. So I could
actually create a real program

165
00:11:05,764 --> 00:11:09,094
for the first time in my life,
but I couldn't do it because I

166
00:11:09,094 --> 00:11:12,303
didn't understand what is a
compiler, what does all of that

167
00:11:12,303 --> 00:11:16,114
mean? Because the book was
completely in English that I got

168
00:11:16,114 --> 00:11:22,489
from a parent, from a, uh, from a
friend. and, um, well, he just

169
00:11:22,489 --> 00:11:25,938
gave me the book here. If you
know English, you can do it If

170
00:11:25,938 --> 00:11:31,818
you don't, well that's it. That's
all the help I can give you. And,

171
00:11:31,818 --> 00:11:36,139
uh, yeah, so it took me quite a
while to, to actually get into,

172
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:41,269
uh, into deeper programming. And
that worked only because we got

173
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:46,038
internet when I was a teenager at
some point. And then we got, um,

174
00:11:46,099 --> 00:11:52,384
like I could create some, some.
Chats and stuff like that, like

175
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:58,803
guest books and things like this
in Pearl went to a php, all the

176
00:11:58,803 --> 00:12:05,403
web related stuff, they
maintained a browser game for

177
00:12:06,063 --> 00:12:10,234
like these, these idle. um,
browser games where you say like,

178
00:12:10,234 --> 00:12:14,553
okay, I'm, I'm clicking here to
build something, and then you

179
00:12:14,553 --> 00:12:19,594
have to come back in two hours
until it's done And uh, yeah, it

180
00:12:19,594 --> 00:12:22,443
was actually a really nice
fantasy game. We had a good

181
00:12:22,443 --> 00:12:26,864
community about like, uh, 1000
people were playing that. And,

182
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:33,903
um, then, um, yeah, we, we also,
we still, um, Know each other.

183
00:12:33,903 --> 00:12:38,073
Like there is still some groups
of people who are talking about

184
00:12:38,073 --> 00:12:42,783
this. We were sharing like, uh,
like holiday, um, vacations

185
00:12:42,788 --> 00:12:48,423
together, like we had, we had a
small, uh, small group of friends

186
00:12:48,514 --> 00:12:57,124
basically established from that.
Um, yeah, then studying and uh,

187
00:12:57,124 --> 00:13:03,078
there I really learned
programming. And got into, like,

188
00:13:03,078 --> 00:13:11,448
I, I wanted to create games for,
um, inside of planes actually,

189
00:13:11,599 --> 00:13:17,058
like, so that the first class
customer can play a poker game

190
00:13:17,058 --> 00:13:18,948
against someone in economy class.

191
00:13:20,354 --> 00:13:20,399
Bekah: That's

192
00:13:20,489 --> 00:13:24,649
Jörn: And, uh, we, we saw that
there, there was basically these,

193
00:13:24,739 --> 00:13:32,509
um, um, these, these. Uh, how do
you call it? Uh, in inside the,

194
00:13:32,538 --> 00:13:36,979
the plane, um, inside the
aircraft. Um, they, they wanted

195
00:13:36,979 --> 00:13:42,259
to create like a network and have
everything on the network, like

196
00:13:42,649 --> 00:13:47,269
videos and, and all of that,
obviously. And you should be able

197
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:52,308
to do not only video or streaming
entertainment, but actually

198
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:58,489
interactive entertainment. Then
we want to get in. So, um, we,

199
00:13:58,489 --> 00:14:05,479
that means, uh, me and a friend
who I met in university. So we

200
00:14:05,479 --> 00:14:11,298
founded a company and tried to
get involved into that and, uh,

201
00:14:11,538 --> 00:14:16,369
yeah, it somehow didn't work out
for the planes, but we created

202
00:14:16,369 --> 00:14:23,509
other multiplayer games with
HTML5 at a time where it was. and

203
00:14:23,509 --> 00:14:27,318
Roy two was like the latest
thing. So it was really hard to

204
00:14:27,318 --> 00:14:34,188
get a performance HTML five game
out there, And yeah, we created

205
00:14:34,278 --> 00:14:40,698
different things like this, but
somehow all of that was more

206
00:14:40,698 --> 00:14:45,153
like, okay, we could do the
technical stuff. but it was, uh,

207
00:14:45,153 --> 00:14:51,274
hard for us, for us to sell
actually. So we, um, we ended up

208
00:14:51,364 --> 00:14:57,394
doing more and more projects and,
uh, got enough and good money

209
00:14:57,423 --> 00:15:02,673
from doing more and more
projects, and that's how I ended

210
00:15:02,673 --> 00:15:09,453
up like in an agency kind of
business. And yeah, at some point

211
00:15:09,453 --> 00:15:16,578
I decided, rid of that, um, and
want to go back into some, some

212
00:15:16,578 --> 00:15:23,298
kind of product business. And,
um, we or I, I decided to, to

213
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:27,259
quit the. that company, it's
still running, so they are still

214
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:32,599
doing something. But, uh, without
me, they are, I think around 15

215
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:37,818
people still. So I was working
out for them, but I wanted to do

216
00:15:37,818 --> 00:15:44,658
something new and, um, I wanted
to help more like the, the, in

217
00:15:44,658 --> 00:15:49,609
the government sector, like we
have seen that there is so

218
00:15:49,609 --> 00:15:56,839
little. New things, innovative
things, it's um, not really user

219
00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:00,619
friendly. Every time you have to
interact with the government,

220
00:16:00,619 --> 00:16:05,808
with a town hall, whatever, then
it's always, uh, a little bit

221
00:16:05,808 --> 00:16:10,548
hard. And we decided we want to
make this better. So we started

222
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:16,953
to create little programs that,
um, should help. like the

223
00:16:17,073 --> 00:16:25,114
citizens and the people who are
working in a city, um, to, to

224
00:16:25,114 --> 00:16:32,193
like, um, yeah, have, have more,
um, or a better view, a better

225
00:16:32,193 --> 00:16:37,504
overview of the city and can, can
do better things basically. Yeah.

226
00:16:38,374 --> 00:16:40,833
So that's my, where, where I
ended up now.

227
00:16:42,379 --> 00:16:46,249
Bekah: That's pretty awesome. So
you've been a founder. Pretty

228
00:16:46,278 --> 00:16:50,869
early on in your career, it
seemed like that was the path

229
00:16:50,869 --> 00:16:55,009
that made most sense for you. Do
you, was that like a decision

230
00:16:55,038 --> 00:16:58,879
that you made or did it just
always seem like a natural fit

231
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,298
for you?

232
00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:04,759
Jörn: Um, so I, I actually didn't
know that there is this career

233
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:09,949
path of, um, founding a company
until, uh, during my studies

234
00:17:09,953 --> 00:17:17,659
like. um, when I was, um, so I
studied quite a long time. So the

235
00:17:17,659 --> 00:17:22,249
first thing that I did was, uh,
studying in one city at the

236
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:25,818
university. And we had like a
math professor who was really,

237
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:33,648
really bad. Um, I. So, so I
always say like, he, he was

238
00:17:33,648 --> 00:17:38,419
talking faster than Eminem reps
and, um, he was saying things

239
00:17:38,423 --> 00:17:42,019
like, okay, this is, this is so
easy. You can read it in the

240
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:46,249
script. And then you read their
script and then you saw like the,

241
00:17:46,249 --> 00:17:50,618
the proof of that is trivial, but
no answer to your questions

242
00:17:50,624 --> 00:17:56,209
basically. So it was really hard
to follow and, um, I, I just

243
00:17:56,209 --> 00:18:01,278
didn't manage it so, then I was a
little bit depressed, like, okay,

244
00:18:01,278 --> 00:18:04,878
what should I do now because I
can't get my computer science

245
00:18:04,878 --> 00:18:10,098
degree? That's what I thought.
So, um, I got an internship with

246
00:18:10,368 --> 00:18:16,078
Luhan Systems in Toronto. So I
worked on something for, Air

247
00:18:16,104 --> 00:18:20,388
Canada with them and uh, was
basically a software tester.

248
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:28,713
During that time, I could create
scripts and um, yeah. Accelerated

249
00:18:29,104 --> 00:18:34,953
our testing processes, like quite
a bit like, was like, uh, a two

250
00:18:34,953 --> 00:18:39,483
week long process of checking two
different lock files with a

251
00:18:39,483 --> 00:18:45,364
couple of gigabytes. Um, and, um,
creating an Excel file out of

252
00:18:45,364 --> 00:18:49,564
that. So you could basically see
what, what were the differences.

253
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:53,943
and that improved the testing
process from like these two weeks

254
00:18:53,943 --> 00:18:58,144
of manual looking at these lock
files into a 20 minute process.

255
00:18:58,713 --> 00:19:03,094
So it was really great and
everybody liked that and they

256
00:19:03,094 --> 00:19:09,304
wanted to actually hire me. And I
said, well, if I do that now, I'm

257
00:19:09,304 --> 00:19:13,743
probably not getting, um,
anywhere like there, there will

258
00:19:13,743 --> 00:19:19,233
be a fixed point where I can't.
over it. So if, if I stay at that

259
00:19:19,233 --> 00:19:23,403
company and, um, so I thought,
okay, I'll try that with a

260
00:19:23,403 --> 00:19:27,663
computer science degree again, in
a different, uh, kind of

261
00:19:27,663 --> 00:19:32,943
university, uh, uni, university
of Applied Sciences, and I could

262
00:19:32,973 --> 00:19:40,203
actually do that there. But we
had this one term, um, well one

263
00:19:40,203 --> 00:19:46,653
semester where we had to, um,
basically. in a company as an

264
00:19:46,653 --> 00:19:50,403
intern, and I already had this
experience, so I didn't really

265
00:19:50,403 --> 00:19:56,074
want to do the same thing again
or something like that. And I

266
00:19:56,074 --> 00:20:02,644
was, uh, still maintaining that
browser game and I wanted to get

267
00:20:02,644 --> 00:20:07,953
this to a next level. So I, um, I
said, okay, what do I have to do

268
00:20:08,314 --> 00:20:13,864
in order to get this into, into
something that I can work on

269
00:20:13,864 --> 00:20:22,848
this. and, um, basically still
tell you my professors, um, that

270
00:20:22,848 --> 00:20:28,788
I'm doing like an internship
during that semester. And, um, I

271
00:20:28,788 --> 00:20:34,999
had to incorporate, uh, well in
general it's called fine. I'm not

272
00:20:34,999 --> 00:20:39,078
sure how it's, how it's called in
English. Um, it's, it's not a

273
00:20:39,078 --> 00:20:45,304
real company. It's more like a,
um, Like a club, sports club or

274
00:20:45,304 --> 00:20:51,304
something. Um, but just for that
game. So we incorporated that and

275
00:20:51,304 --> 00:20:58,413
then I could basically get there
as an intern and, uh, work on

276
00:20:58,413 --> 00:21:03,273
that stuff. And, uh, yeah, I, I
did that this one semester. They

277
00:21:03,273 --> 00:21:05,523
said everything's fine. Great.
Cool.

278
00:21:06,019 --> 00:21:09,229
Dan: So you were an intern at
your own, at your own company.

279
00:21:09,858 --> 00:21:10,969
Jörn: Yeah, basically

280
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:11,388
Dan: That's awesome.

281
00:21:12,469 --> 00:21:16,788
Jörn: But in order to know how to
incorporate, um, I had to ask

282
00:21:16,788 --> 00:21:21,979
someone at the university who was
doing like these, um, like

283
00:21:21,983 --> 00:21:27,124
helping people to found their own
companies and. Well, I talked to

284
00:21:27,124 --> 00:21:31,413
him. I don't want to own my own
company. Like I think that's way

285
00:21:31,413 --> 00:21:34,713
too involved. I just want to do
that small little thing. So he

286
00:21:34,713 --> 00:21:38,554
told me what to do there, but I
was in this newsletter now and he

287
00:21:38,854 --> 00:21:43,114
wouldn't let me go. Like he was
always pushing me into like, you

288
00:21:43,114 --> 00:21:49,263
are the kind of person that is a
founder and you should just

289
00:21:49,263 --> 00:21:54,064
accept it, that you are. You're
doing things all the time and you

290
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:58,669
want to. Things your own way. So
you are actually that kind of

291
00:21:58,669 --> 00:22:03,469
personality to do that. And I,
um, well, it didn't occur to me

292
00:22:03,709 --> 00:22:09,138
until, well, he told me like
multiple times and I have seen

293
00:22:09,138 --> 00:22:14,298
that buildings things from the
ground up is really fun and I

294
00:22:14,388 --> 00:22:20,209
really like it. But yeah, it's,
it's also very involved so. Work

295
00:22:20,479 --> 00:22:27,469
late and long and all of that. So
yeah, I don't know, but it's,

296
00:22:27,469 --> 00:22:28,939
it's fun still. So,

297
00:22:30,106 --> 00:22:33,346
Bekah: what do you think some of
the biggest challenges have been

298
00:22:33,406 --> 00:22:35,217
in founding your own companies?

299
00:22:36,012 --> 00:22:41,040
Jörn: um, How to, how to say, I
think bureaucracy is, uh,

300
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:47,760
something that I really hate. I
know that it's necessary, but I

301
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:54,121
really, um, hate if you have to
read through like this, this, uh,

302
00:22:54,181 --> 00:23:05,191
lawyer language, um, that that's
very, um, energy draining. Um, I

303
00:23:05,195 --> 00:23:13,891
think many people have struggled
with finding other people, and I

304
00:23:13,891 --> 00:23:22,861
think that somehow works out for
me. Um, like I, I wouldn't found

305
00:23:22,861 --> 00:23:28,816
my own company just by myself.
Like I, I need other people. Um,

306
00:23:29,056 --> 00:23:34,516
and I, I need other people who
have different interests so that

307
00:23:34,516 --> 00:23:41,236
we can share the workload
basically, and, um, try to, um,

308
00:23:41,385 --> 00:23:47,746
to, to get better at everything
basically. And, uh, yeah, but

309
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:53,340
really the, the hardest, hardest
is probably just the. all, all

310
00:23:53,346 --> 00:23:59,250
around it. Like the, all the
lawyer stuff, Texas and all of

311
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:03,330
the things that is not about
building the product, doing

312
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:08,330
something around the, the product
or, or whatever you do, actually.

313
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:13,681
Dan: So do you try to find a
founder or a partner, whatever,

314
00:24:13,681 --> 00:24:18,810
that can do that stuff and not
much of the building stuff or

315
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,601
like what, like what, what, you
know, how, how do you, or do you

316
00:24:21,601 --> 00:24:25,320
try to like learn that stuff, you
know, anyway, you know what I

317
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:25,441
mean?

318
00:24:26,278 --> 00:24:30,298
Jörn: so, uh, the, the person
that I told you about who, um,

319
00:24:30,448 --> 00:24:35,127
who gave me that, Hey, you should
phone your own company. Um, he,

320
00:24:36,087 --> 00:24:41,698
uh, this, this counselor,
basically, he said that, um, he

321
00:24:41,702 --> 00:24:49,123
started with economics and now he
thinks like, Bad idea to, um,

322
00:24:49,153 --> 00:24:53,083
just do the business
administration and then try to

323
00:24:53,502 --> 00:24:57,492
get into tech, for example, to
build your own stuff. He would

324
00:24:57,823 --> 00:25:02,532
very much like it, way more to,
um, study computer science, do

325
00:25:02,538 --> 00:25:06,313
something like this so that he
can build something. Because all

326
00:25:06,313 --> 00:25:09,853
the stuff that he learned, he
said that's something that you

327
00:25:09,853 --> 00:25:17,127
can get on your, um, in, in your
head anyways. And. Actually, you

328
00:25:17,127 --> 00:25:22,498
don't, you don't get around this
at all. Like you, you can't just

329
00:25:22,498 --> 00:25:26,698
say like, okay, someone else is
doing that for me. Like all the,

330
00:25:26,907 --> 00:25:31,198
all that part because in the end
you will still be personally

331
00:25:31,198 --> 00:25:37,347
responsible for whatever you are
doing or not doing, basically.

332
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:44,758
So, um, I think it's more like I.
Always looked into, into people

333
00:25:44,758 --> 00:25:48,837
who can help me more with the
things that I'm not that good at.

334
00:25:49,768 --> 00:25:57,928
Um, but just for taxes and things
like this, I think we, um, or

335
00:25:57,928 --> 00:26:02,038
everyone that I, that I worked
with, was more on, on the

336
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:08,698
agreement that, uh, we let that
do like a tax, uh, consultancy,

337
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:16,798
for example, help us with this.
then, um, yeah, all, all of these

338
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:19,347
things we try to outsource
basically

339
00:26:20,113 --> 00:26:20,833
Dan: Yeah, sure. Yeah.

340
00:26:21,327 --> 00:26:26,307
Jörn: but yeah, it's, it's
costly, but I think, um, it's way

341
00:26:26,307 --> 00:26:33,298
better to have a better and, um,
bigger, um, product then, um, try

342
00:26:33,298 --> 00:26:39,387
to save some little money there.

343
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:44,877
Bekah: Yeah, there was a podcast
that I listened to a couple of

344
00:26:44,877 --> 00:26:50,097
years ago and it was talking
about, um, I can't remember how

345
00:26:50,097 --> 00:26:53,218
they framed it, but it was kind
of relationships and so they

346
00:26:53,218 --> 00:26:57,958
examined different relationships,
uh, and it, there were people who

347
00:26:57,958 --> 00:27:01,417
were married, there were people
who were co-founders. There were

348
00:27:01,423 --> 00:27:03,597
people who were on teams
together, but they were saying

349
00:27:03,597 --> 00:27:07,512
like, all of those relationships
kind. you, you function within

350
00:27:07,512 --> 00:27:11,353
similar roles, right? And like
complementarity was a really big

351
00:27:11,353 --> 00:27:14,772
part of that. And I think that,
you know, that's important in

352
00:27:14,772 --> 00:27:18,792
that founder journey and, or you
know, whatever journey you are

353
00:27:18,792 --> 00:27:22,542
working with other people or
teams of people. But then as part

354
00:27:22,542 --> 00:27:26,063
of that, like being able to
recognize like this is. Something

355
00:27:26,063 --> 00:27:30,532
that, that we should outsource to
someone else. It makes more sense

356
00:27:30,532 --> 00:27:33,833
long term to be able to make that
decision and maybe spend that

357
00:27:33,833 --> 00:27:38,363
extra money rather than, uh,
spending that time trying to do

358
00:27:38,363 --> 00:27:41,903
it ourselves. I think that's a
really, it can be a hard decision

359
00:27:41,907 --> 00:27:43,702
to make, but a really smart one.

360
00:27:46,238 --> 00:27:53,292
Jörn: Yeah. I, I, I guess so.
Like I, I think. One, one thing

361
00:27:53,292 --> 00:27:57,553
that I, that I learned also was,
um, okay, if you, if you have

362
00:27:57,553 --> 00:28:03,942
shares at a company and like, if
you can sell that company for,

363
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:10,212
let, let's pretend like, uh, 1000
euros, then you will get your

364
00:28:10,212 --> 00:28:16,468
shares from that if you get
someone else. Like you, you have

365
00:28:16,468 --> 00:28:21,867
100%, you get 1000 euros for it.
Basically, if you have 50%

366
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:27,268
shares, you get, uh, 500, uh,
euros from it if someone else has

367
00:28:27,268 --> 00:28:35,728
50. But if the other 50% give you
like an extra boost so you can

368
00:28:35,728 --> 00:28:40,587
sell it for 10,000, you will end
up with 5,000 euros instead of

369
00:28:40,587 --> 00:28:47,488
1000 euros. So it's a way better
deal. So, um, if you, if you can

370
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:53,218
find people who can, um, make
your company better, um, in, in

371
00:28:53,218 --> 00:28:58,107
that regard, um, it will, it will
help you in the long run as well.

372
00:28:58,107 --> 00:29:04,218
So I think it always makes sense
to, to focus on the things that.

373
00:29:05,758 --> 00:29:11,157
work out well and try to improve
the company itself instead of,

374
00:29:11,397 --> 00:29:17,518
um, trying to like save a little
bit here or there instead. But

375
00:29:17,847 --> 00:29:24,508
yeah, you can't always, um, say,
okay, I'm not going to save on

376
00:29:24,508 --> 00:29:25,887
that or no.

377
00:29:27,282 --> 00:29:29,728
Bekah: Yeah. What is the size of
your company? Right.

378
00:29:31,528 --> 00:29:37,468
Jörn: Um, so we are six people
right now. and, um, but well to

379
00:29:37,468 --> 00:29:42,298
working students and, uh, the
rest, full-time, um, two founders

380
00:29:42,298 --> 00:29:52,827
basically. And, uh, yeah, we are
looking to, um, well just, get

381
00:29:52,827 --> 00:29:57,117
the projects done that we
currently have for our, uh, our

382
00:29:57,208 --> 00:30:05,532
current thing. But then, uh, try.
to focus on products again. So I

383
00:30:05,593 --> 00:30:10,603
don't think that we are going to,
to, um, look for investment

384
00:30:10,633 --> 00:30:15,972
money. So, um, we kind of like
this bootstrapping mode cause you

385
00:30:15,972 --> 00:30:22,722
are actually forced to always,
um, create value and, um, if, if

386
00:30:22,722 --> 00:30:27,732
you have this investment money
where you can say, okay. we are

387
00:30:27,738 --> 00:30:33,553
all safe now. Then you probably
lose a little bit of this energy

388
00:30:33,553 --> 00:30:37,393
of, okay, well I have to, I have
to create, well, you know,

389
00:30:37,482 --> 00:30:41,232
because I need that money and I
only get that money from

390
00:30:41,232 --> 00:30:47,732
customers and not from somewhere
So, um, it kind of makes sense, I

391
00:30:47,732 --> 00:30:54,028
think. It's may, maybe later. It
could make sense if you, if you

392
00:30:54,028 --> 00:30:57,208
have a real product where you
want to get a really big

393
00:30:57,208 --> 00:31:02,728
marketing budget or something,
um, or try to expand in a

394
00:31:02,728 --> 00:31:06,357
different area where you don't
have really any connection to

395
00:31:06,357 --> 00:31:12,238
yet. Um, but yeah, I, I think
the, the bootstrapping thing, uh,

396
00:31:12,377 --> 00:31:15,337
just makes sense cuz you have to
work more.

397
00:31:17,468 --> 00:31:22,857
Dan: So the plan would be to
kind. When you've moved over back

398
00:31:22,857 --> 00:31:26,188
over to products, would you kind
of keep some contracts or, you

399
00:31:26,188 --> 00:31:29,667
know, still do some contract work
to keep paying the bills? Or are

400
00:31:29,958 --> 00:31:32,248
you guys kind of just saving up
enough that you can focus

401
00:31:32,488 --> 00:31:35,817
entirely the entire company on,
product, product work,

402
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,923
Jörn: It's a, it's a good
question,

403
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:42,298
Dan: if it's a, if it's a secret
plan, you don't, you don't have

404
00:31:42,298 --> 00:31:43,738
to, you don't have to, you know,
reveal

405
00:31:43,948 --> 00:31:48,327
Jörn: No, no, no. Um, it's, it's
definitely, uh, definitely we

406
00:31:48,327 --> 00:31:55,317
will, um, keep on doing, um,
projects, um, just because we, we

407
00:31:55,317 --> 00:32:02,428
won't be able to, um, completely
lose that. I guess I, I think we

408
00:32:02,428 --> 00:32:06,448
will have, after this project
right now, we should have enough

409
00:32:06,448 --> 00:32:12,373
runway to. I have a few months of
focus work on the product, but

410
00:32:12,373 --> 00:32:18,732
still, I don't think that you can
create a product that fast with

411
00:32:18,732 --> 00:32:26,323
that much, um, monthly recurring
revenue, so fast and easy that,

412
00:32:26,472 --> 00:32:31,393
um, you can sustain a company
for, for a long time, like, or

413
00:32:31,843 --> 00:32:35,982
right away basically. I think
it's, it's really hard to, to

414
00:32:35,982 --> 00:32:42,597
get. But the, uh, a good lesson
that you can learn from this, uh,

415
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:47,067
y Combinator startup school kind
of thing. They, they always say

416
00:32:47,073 --> 00:32:51,807
like, okay, the, the biggest
issue for startups or the, the

417
00:32:51,813 --> 00:32:55,647
biggest thing that you need to do
is, or concentrate on, is to not

418
00:32:55,647 --> 00:33:03,873
die. Just don't die as a company.
And so many things work out. I

419
00:33:03,877 --> 00:33:08,202
think if you, if you do something
and you find out, okay, that is

420
00:33:08,202 --> 00:33:13,032
not financially sustainable, you
have to stop it, otherwise you,

421
00:33:13,452 --> 00:33:15,163
you will die and yeah.

422
00:33:16,498 --> 00:33:18,778
Dan: Yeah, I think, I think
that's really cool. I, it reminds

423
00:33:18,778 --> 00:33:22,167
me of, uh, and I mean lots of
people have done it, but, um, 37

424
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:25,048
Signals are, I, I guess they just
changed their name to Basecamp.

425
00:33:25,077 --> 00:33:27,778
But, you know, the Basecamp folks
did the same thing. You know,

426
00:33:27,778 --> 00:33:30,208
they, they did it, they started
out just purely as a client

427
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:34,498
company. And then, um, well, I
think they made Basecamp because,

428
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:37,587
for internal use, honestly. And
then they decided, you know, and

429
00:33:37,587 --> 00:33:39,657
then they were like, Hey, we
should, we should probably, we

430
00:33:39,657 --> 00:33:45,313
should just make this a full on
product. But, um, I, I, I. No, I

431
00:33:45,313 --> 00:33:47,383
appreciate that approach a lot.
You know, and I think that's a

432
00:33:47,383 --> 00:33:50,292
smart way, I like the way you
said it cuz there's, there's a

433
00:33:50,292 --> 00:33:52,992
lot of trade-offs of taking
investment money. Um, and you

434
00:33:52,992 --> 00:33:55,873
hear about some of them, you
know, I mean, we, you relinquish

435
00:33:55,873 --> 00:33:58,692
some control and all that stuff.
But the, what you said about the

436
00:33:58,698 --> 00:34:01,423
energy, I, I think I, I really
appreciated that how, how you get

437
00:34:01,962 --> 00:34:05,913
this big influx of money and you
lose all that urgency and the,

438
00:34:05,913 --> 00:34:08,052
and the, you know, kind of
day-to-day stuff. I think that's,

439
00:34:08,742 --> 00:34:10,092
it makes a lot of sense to me
anyway.

440
00:34:10,693 --> 00:34:13,543
Jörn: Well, sometimes I think it,
it would be great if you

441
00:34:13,588 --> 00:34:14,038
Dan: Well, sure,

442
00:34:14,327 --> 00:34:18,373
Jörn: have that right like it can
stress you out quite a bit. But

443
00:34:18,672 --> 00:34:25,273
yeah, I, I don't know. Like, um,
once you have a big, um, client

444
00:34:25,273 --> 00:34:30,043
contract for example, and you,
you got it and you know that you

445
00:34:30,043 --> 00:34:33,972
will be like, for the rest of the
year you are totally booked,

446
00:34:34,123 --> 00:34:38,893
whatever, and it works out for
your company. As a whole, then

447
00:34:39,552 --> 00:34:47,472
that's so, like, that's you who
has done this, right? So it's way

448
00:34:47,472 --> 00:34:53,592
more powerful than having someone
else do that for you. And yeah,

449
00:34:53,632 --> 00:34:57,702
I, I think it energizes you a lot
more to, to get there.

450
00:35:00,228 --> 00:35:02,538
Bekah: You are a fully remote
company, right?

451
00:35:03,882 --> 00:35:07,963
Jörn: Yes, I, the first company
wasn't fully remote. Um, this one

452
00:35:07,963 --> 00:35:14,443
now is, and I kind of like it.
Um, but we are doing that only

453
00:35:14,443 --> 00:35:17,193
with, um, in inside of Germany.

454
00:35:17,918 --> 00:35:18,527
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

455
00:35:18,913 --> 00:35:23,202
Jörn: Because of, as I said
before, the we are outsourcing

456
00:35:23,202 --> 00:35:28,182
everything to tax consultancy,
for example. And they told us if

457
00:35:28,182 --> 00:35:32,293
you want to have other people
from other countries, that will

458
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:35,952
cost you a lot more. And we
thought like, okay, well there

459
00:35:35,952 --> 00:35:41,143
are enough people living in
Germany who can help us for now.

460
00:35:42,322 --> 00:35:46,588
But yeah, I, I think also I made
the experience with, uh,

461
00:35:46,617 --> 00:35:52,378
different time zones. It can be a
little bit tricky also in the, in

462
00:35:52,382 --> 00:35:57,297
the current, um, well the, the
current industry that we are in,

463
00:35:57,327 --> 00:36:02,757
like public administrations, it's
uh, basically always only German.

464
00:36:02,847 --> 00:36:10,288
So we, um, we need people who can
speak and understand German in

465
00:36:10,288 --> 00:36:15,898
this regard. and, um, yeah,
that's, that's basically what we

466
00:36:15,898 --> 00:36:21,177
are, uh, working with right now.
So it's, uh, it would be hard to,

467
00:36:21,597 --> 00:36:25,708
to change this, but it's, it's
not from the table, so I would

468
00:36:25,947 --> 00:36:30,838
definitely say okay, if we find
someone really good for a task

469
00:36:30,838 --> 00:36:35,938
that we really need help with,
then um, we are definitely open

470
00:36:35,938 --> 00:36:39,467
for anything there. But yeah.

471
00:36:40,047 --> 00:36:43,347
Bekah: And when you founded the
company, it was a couple years

472
00:36:43,353 --> 00:36:47,742
prior to the pandemic. Right. And
then, Moved into the pandemic,

473
00:36:47,742 --> 00:36:51,402
and I know I talked to a lot of
founders who really found that

474
00:36:51,407 --> 00:36:56,382
time to be challenging or maybe
that was where they ended their

475
00:36:56,563 --> 00:37:00,163
business. Um, what was that
experience like for you?

476
00:37:02,302 --> 00:37:08,503
Jörn: Okay, so, um, the, the
start of the pandemic is still,

477
00:37:08,507 --> 00:37:15,762
uh, really. Um, tough time for me
because like, it happened a lot

478
00:37:15,762 --> 00:37:22,842
of stuff like was the, like the,
the week where there was the

479
00:37:22,842 --> 00:37:28,632
first lockdown in Germany the
week before we got our daughter.

480
00:37:29,052 --> 00:37:35,427
So my, my first child. and, um,
it was a Thursday and on Monday

481
00:37:35,427 --> 00:37:39,898
there was the lockdown. So my
wife got out of the hospital on,

482
00:37:39,987 --> 00:37:45,297
on Monday with the child. Um, it
was lockdown day and the day

483
00:37:45,297 --> 00:37:52,557
before our daughter was born, her
father died. So there was really,

484
00:37:52,887 --> 00:38:01,108
uh, a weird situation like it's
three very. Uh, hardcore things

485
00:38:01,887 --> 00:38:06,927
that, that happen at the same
time. So I really didn't have to,

486
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:13,047
um, I, I didn't, or I couldn't
really think of lots of, um,

487
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:19,407
stuff around that, right. So I'm,
I wasn't, um, I wasn't really

488
00:38:19,407 --> 00:38:25,047
thinking too much about, okay,
how. How is, uh, this going to,

489
00:38:25,137 --> 00:38:28,648
to change anything because we
were still like, okay, our

490
00:38:28,648 --> 00:38:34,588
company is, is working. We still
have our clients. Um, we had

491
00:38:34,648 --> 00:38:41,427
issues then with, um, like some,
some projects that we were really

492
00:38:42,057 --> 00:38:47,367
thinking that, um, that they
will, um, come, didn't come.

493
00:38:47,697 --> 00:38:52,663
Basically like a lot of other
client companies were. Mainly

494
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:58,003
saying, okay. Um, we are not
going to do that anymore. We were

495
00:38:58,003 --> 00:39:03,822
already, um, well we, we already
said before the pandemic hits

496
00:39:04,273 --> 00:39:08,623
that we want to, uh, focus more
on these public administrations,

497
00:39:08,623 --> 00:39:13,302
but we still did client work for
private companies, so basically

498
00:39:13,572 --> 00:39:18,163
building web applications for,
for bigger companies there. So,

499
00:39:18,193 --> 00:39:26,833
um, We try to, to get into, into
different things that, uh, worked

500
00:39:26,833 --> 00:39:31,182
during the pandemic. Like there,
there were a couple of

501
00:39:31,213 --> 00:39:36,972
applications that tried to help
with the pandemic for, for

502
00:39:36,972 --> 00:39:44,083
example. So we, um, made contract
work for them and um, yeah, had

503
00:39:44,353 --> 00:39:50,097
different things like this, but.
I don't know. We just focused on

504
00:39:50,487 --> 00:40:00,521
do not die the whole time. So in,
in all the senses, So Kit do not

505
00:40:00,521 --> 00:40:07,920
die. My wife don't die to
depression or something. Company

506
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:12,791
don't die because we all need
money. And um, yeah, so.

507
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:19,240
Bekah: That's really intense,
that That's a lot. Um, hoping

508
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:22,990
things that are feeling better
now, maybe hopeful.

509
00:40:24,206 --> 00:40:29,905
Jörn: Yeah. Yeah, definitely. No,
it's, uh, it, it's been, uh, two

510
00:40:29,905 --> 00:40:34,735
years now. So I think, um, we
are, we're getting, we are

511
00:40:34,735 --> 00:40:39,445
getting somewhere again. Also,
I'm very optimistic, like I'm ex

512
00:40:39,536 --> 00:40:43,556
extremely optimistic all the
time, so I always thought of this

513
00:40:43,556 --> 00:40:51,161
like, this will going to be hard
and, or this is hard, but it will

514
00:40:51,161 --> 00:40:55,840
end at some point in time. So I
just have to, to get through this

515
00:40:56,411 --> 00:41:00,400
and then at some point it will
get better and it will feel it

516
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:08,141
once it's there. So, um, I think
that helps a lot. And, uh, yeah,

517
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:15,536
I don't know, my, my best man
told me, um, that he, he finds it

518
00:41:15,945 --> 00:41:20,516
interesting how I can get from,
from these experiences and just

519
00:41:21,505 --> 00:41:26,576
get back up and say, and say
like, okay, well then let's do it

520
00:41:26,576 --> 00:41:31,016
differently, if it doesn't work
out that way, basically. But, uh,

521
00:41:31,016 --> 00:41:37,376
never, never, uh, give up and try
to like, I, I don't know. What,

522
00:41:37,376 --> 00:41:41,501
what should you do? He would say
like, okay, it doesn't work out.

523
00:41:41,621 --> 00:41:47,800
Okay, well then find something
else. I guess So you have to,

524
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,490
anyways.

525
00:41:49,255 --> 00:41:52,990
Dan: I feel like that, uh,
attitude is, Seems like really,

526
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:55,900
really important for a founder,
for a good founder, you know, um,

527
00:41:56,501 --> 00:41:59,351
being able, uh, you know,
everything that I've read and the

528
00:41:59,351 --> 00:42:01,931
people that I follow that do
this, you know, talk about like

529
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,771
how failure is part of this
process, you know, and, and, and

530
00:42:05,831 --> 00:42:09,670
a lot of, uh, y you can't always
count on everything working out

531
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:11,951
exactly right. You know, and so
being able to pick yourself up

532
00:42:11,951 --> 00:42:14,501
and say, okay, let's try
something different and not just

533
00:42:14,681 --> 00:42:18,251
quit, you know, like, not rage
quit or, or keep trying to pound

534
00:42:18,251 --> 00:42:21,206
in the same. That's not working,
you know, other people, I mean,

535
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:23,456
I've, I've seen that happen too.
You know what I mean? And I

536
00:42:23,456 --> 00:42:26,246
think, uh, I think that seems
like a really good and healthy,

537
00:42:26,275 --> 00:42:30,806
uh, attitude for, for somebody
that's wants to do, you know, you

538
00:42:30,806 --> 00:42:32,675
know, this sort of thing. I think
that's cool.

539
00:42:34,076 --> 00:42:40,945
Jörn: I think it helps. Yes. But
yeah, I, I also believe that the,

540
00:42:41,005 --> 00:42:45,565
the team itself, um, needs to,
needs to be something, right?

541
00:42:45,565 --> 00:42:50,065
Like the, the team needs to be
good. I don't think that one

542
00:42:50,065 --> 00:42:57,175
person alone can, can do. like
really big things you always need

543
00:42:57,775 --> 00:43:02,905
a team for, for that. Even if
it's like, okay, people are

544
00:43:02,905 --> 00:43:07,255
saying something in a meeting and
then this one person can connect

545
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:12,565
all these ideas and say, okay,
our ideas know this. You know,

546
00:43:12,565 --> 00:43:17,215
like if, if you don't have the
team around you who are talking.

547
00:43:18,056 --> 00:43:24,206
Really good things or creating
impulses that you can use, then

548
00:43:24,445 --> 00:43:28,556
you won't get there. We will, I,
I don't think that you, that you

549
00:43:28,556 --> 00:43:33,266
can actually create something
great if you, if you're just for

550
00:43:33,266 --> 00:43:39,686
yourself alone without these
external impulses there. And, uh,

551
00:43:39,775 --> 00:43:43,016
yeah, if you want to create
something quick, then you

552
00:43:43,465 --> 00:43:45,686
probably also need a couple of
other people who can help you

553
00:43:45,905 --> 00:43:46,065
with.

554
00:43:46,481 --> 00:43:51,492
Dan: Since you're our, uh, fully
remote, um, team, like what are

555
00:43:51,492 --> 00:43:55,902
some ways that you foster that
sort of. That's sort of like idea

556
00:43:55,902 --> 00:43:57,882
making and, you know,
communication and things like

557
00:43:57,882 --> 00:44:01,331
that. Like do you do daily
standups? Do you, do you know,

558
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:02,411
what kind of stuff do you do,

559
00:44:03,282 --> 00:44:08,322
Jörn: we, we do and we do it
especially because like, I have

560
00:44:08,322 --> 00:44:15,311
to get up at some point in the
morning so it's, it's more like

561
00:44:15,311 --> 00:44:22,092
this, uh, trying, um, trying to
get me out of bed more or more in

562
00:44:22,311 --> 00:44:28,271
the morning because of, um, I'm,
I'm a very, like you have seen me

563
00:44:28,271 --> 00:44:32,157
in the co-working room around
like 3:00 AM. during the week

564
00:44:33,086 --> 00:44:38,306
sometimes. And this is not, uh,
not really the, the way that it,

565
00:44:38,516 --> 00:44:43,646
uh, should work. And I'm
definitely not like the, the, uh,

566
00:44:43,677 --> 00:44:47,817
role model for how you should
work. I guess. It's, it's more

567
00:44:47,817 --> 00:44:53,577
this, uh, and try to, to have
everybody be healthy and, and do

568
00:44:53,577 --> 00:44:58,811
their things that. that work out
for them. But for me, sometimes

569
00:44:58,811 --> 00:45:03,882
it just works out best if I work
late in the night, but then maybe

570
00:45:03,882 --> 00:45:09,311
the next day I sleep a couple of
hours during the day. Doesn't,

571
00:45:09,972 --> 00:45:15,161
doesn't really matter that much
there. So, um, as long as the, as

572
00:45:15,161 --> 00:45:20,501
long as the work that I do is
still, uh, working out. And, um,

573
00:45:20,501 --> 00:45:23,442
yeah. As you, as you said to, to
create these impulses. Yeah,

574
00:45:23,442 --> 00:45:28,871
definitely. We have, uh, our
dailies and, um, we, we have

575
00:45:28,876 --> 00:45:35,681
meetings to, to talk about things
like this. Um, like where we,

576
00:45:35,742 --> 00:45:40,992
where we do this, we also, um,
Had workshops where we just

577
00:45:41,052 --> 00:45:47,081
gathered together. Um, so we
still have some rooms to, to go

578
00:45:47,112 --> 00:45:52,722
some if, if we want to or need
to. I mean, right now we are

579
00:45:52,722 --> 00:45:57,311
focusing more on the client
projects, but while the client

580
00:45:57,311 --> 00:46:02,231
being a bigger public
administration right now, so, um,

581
00:46:02,831 --> 00:46:07,032
we are just trying to, to do our
best work there, but it doesn't

582
00:46:07,032 --> 00:46:12,027
really. Like this creative
impulses there

583
00:46:12,086 --> 00:46:12,717
Dan: Yeah, sure.

584
00:46:12,806 --> 00:46:16,436
Jörn: right now, So when, when
you, when you just have to like,

585
00:46:16,436 --> 00:46:20,726
okay, do that work. And we, we
know that it's going, it's going

586
00:46:20,726 --> 00:46:27,237
to, to pay, pay our bills,
basically. But um, yeah, once we,

587
00:46:27,297 --> 00:46:31,436
once we have this, We will
definitely have another meeting

588
00:46:31,436 --> 00:46:37,376
and another more strategic
approach towards our products.

589
00:46:37,376 --> 00:46:44,976
Again, so always or that, depends
on what our current, uh, work

590
00:46:44,976 --> 00:46:45,516
mode is.

591
00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:50,474
Dan: I like that. I don't know if
you are able to, but are you able

592
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:55,063
to share what your sort of next,
like the product thing is that

593
00:46:55,063 --> 00:46:58,498
you are hoping to move? Or is
that, uh, it's okay if it's

594
00:46:58,498 --> 00:47:00,298
secret. You don't Yeah. You don't
have to

595
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:02,759
Bekah: it is top secret, you
should still tell us anyway,

596
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:04,559
Dan: yeah. Or you could tell, you
could tell us

597
00:47:04,798 --> 00:47:07,289
Bekah: that you heard it first on
the Virtual Coffee Podcast.

598
00:47:07,724 --> 00:47:11,143
Jörn: No, no, it's, it's not,
it's not secret. So we are

599
00:47:11,143 --> 00:47:18,373
building, um, like a, um, a
damage reporter kind of, um,

600
00:47:18,403 --> 00:47:26,954
product. But, um, so basically
every, um, every city has, has

601
00:47:26,958 --> 00:47:31,063
something like this already. And
you would think like, okay, well

602
00:47:31,184 --> 00:47:36,074
why should you build something
like that? And the. The thing is,

603
00:47:36,074 --> 00:47:42,043
what we want to do is we want to
create like smaller products to

604
00:47:42,164 --> 00:47:46,244
get inside of the public
administrations to teach them

605
00:47:46,244 --> 00:47:52,559
that like digital products. Are
something that can actually be

606
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:58,978
good and you, you, you can do
something with it. So our product

607
00:47:59,039 --> 00:48:03,568
is not really focusing on the
citizen, like, okay, it will be

608
00:48:03,568 --> 00:48:08,699
easy for a citizen to report a
damage somewhere, or like the

609
00:48:08,704 --> 00:48:12,898
garbage trash cans are, um,
spilled over at the playground.

610
00:48:12,898 --> 00:48:17,784
So you want to report that you do
that through their website. But

611
00:48:17,844 --> 00:48:24,623
usually it's like, okay, there's
going to be some mail to, to the

612
00:48:24,653 --> 00:48:27,773
public administration and then
they say, okay, well maybe we'll

613
00:48:27,773 --> 00:48:32,184
do that when we will do something
about that. But they don't really

614
00:48:32,184 --> 00:48:37,853
care too much about what, what
this means in general. Like if

615
00:48:38,304 --> 00:48:42,893
there are multiple reports of
that in the same area, maybe they

616
00:48:42,893 --> 00:48:49,664
want to tell the police that
they. for maybe some teenagers

617
00:48:49,724 --> 00:48:54,764
doing weird things every weekend,
basically. And you can see that

618
00:48:54,764 --> 00:49:00,643
if you, um, if, if you have some
kind of mechanism to, to track

619
00:49:00,643 --> 00:49:05,983
these things a little bit more
easily. So, um, we are building

620
00:49:07,273 --> 00:49:14,023
products like this in order to,
um, to show them. As the public

621
00:49:14,023 --> 00:49:19,304
administration, you have new
possibilities. Now you have, um,

622
00:49:19,514 --> 00:49:24,313
more things that you can do with
that. And we want to use these

623
00:49:24,344 --> 00:49:31,213
smaller products to get into the,
okay, what can we do to, to get

624
00:49:31,704 --> 00:49:37,675
bigger, like into bigger projects
that you want to tackle. You want

625
00:49:37,679 --> 00:49:45,088
to show them. All of the bigger
projects are failures. If you

626
00:49:45,298 --> 00:49:50,159
talk and if you have trust in, in
the people who are building that

627
00:49:50,159 --> 00:49:57,838
with you. And I think there is a
really big problem right now. Um,

628
00:49:57,844 --> 00:50:03,268
when you, when you hear stories
about, okay, what, where's the

629
00:50:03,273 --> 00:50:08,608
tax money going? Right? People
are building. um, projects or

630
00:50:08,608 --> 00:50:13,349
doing projects for, for the
government, they use lots of

631
00:50:13,349 --> 00:50:18,088
money, and in the end you get
something. Well, they could have

632
00:50:18,094 --> 00:50:23,849
used an Excel sheet for that you
know, that, that's how it feels

633
00:50:23,849 --> 00:50:29,039
like when you, when you're a
taxpayer there. And I think the,

634
00:50:29,789 --> 00:50:34,768
the thing that we want to, to do
is more like, okay, we want to

635
00:50:34,829 --> 00:50:40,648
customize. Things really to, to
the administration so that it

636
00:50:40,648 --> 00:50:47,128
really makes sense. And it's not
necessarily just an Excel sheet

637
00:50:47,338 --> 00:50:52,079
basically, but, um, you should,
you should really have like a

638
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:58,378
good, well thought out and
connected experience. In, in all

639
00:50:58,378 --> 00:51:02,489
of what you, what you do. But we
want to grow into that and not

640
00:51:02,699 --> 00:51:06,628
like, okay, we will build
something and then take it

641
00:51:06,929 --> 00:51:10,349
because that won't work.
Especially not as a small

642
00:51:10,353 --> 00:51:15,659
company. So it's more like, okay,
we are testing, uh, different

643
00:51:15,659 --> 00:51:19,679
things with different small
products, and then we will, um,

644
00:51:20,338 --> 00:51:24,509
eventually get somewhere, I
guess. and it already landed us

645
00:51:24,509 --> 00:51:30,599
some, some of these projects. So,
um, it kind of works out, I think

646
00:51:31,748 --> 00:51:32,139
Bekah: Nice.

647
00:51:32,188 --> 00:51:35,742
Dan: I think that's awesome. I,
yeah, it sounds very complicated

648
00:51:35,748 --> 00:51:38,862
and it sounds like a lot of
talking and bureau and

649
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:40,963
bureaucracy, which I think you
said you didn't like at the

650
00:51:40,963 --> 00:51:42,733
beginning of the, the podcast,
but

651
00:51:43,518 --> 00:51:44,498
Jörn: Yes, yes.

652
00:51:44,652 --> 00:51:49,302
Dan: I, as a taxpayer and as, as
a, um, you know, Citizen of a of,

653
00:51:49,362 --> 00:51:53,432
of, yeah. Of a human being. I, I
think that's great. I am all, all

654
00:51:53,432 --> 00:51:55,592
for that. And I think your
approach sounds really cool too

655
00:51:55,592 --> 00:51:59,072
because, you know, you hear
about, um, I think the

656
00:51:59,072 --> 00:52:02,612
traditional experiences I've come
near and, and I've never worked

657
00:52:02,612 --> 00:52:05,793
with government contracts or
anything, but is, is like they

658
00:52:06,032 --> 00:52:08,882
say, oh, we need this thing and
put out a request, you know, and

659
00:52:08,943 --> 00:52:13,293
people bid on it and all that
stuff. And that, I think is

660
00:52:13,297 --> 00:52:17,463
usually a recipe for disaster.
point, it's too late. Right?

661
00:52:17,733 --> 00:52:20,163
because they've probably decided
the wrong thing that they need.

662
00:52:20,222 --> 00:52:23,432
You know, I, we deal with this a
lot with our client work, um,

663
00:52:23,822 --> 00:52:28,143
where a client will come and say,
Hey, we need X. You know, they,

664
00:52:28,143 --> 00:52:30,273
they've talked or whatever for
their company and they're like,

665
00:52:30,273 --> 00:52:33,152
we need this thing, you know, and
they're trying to hire it. And,

666
00:52:33,572 --> 00:52:36,333
um, last times with sprockets,
what we do is we get in and learn

667
00:52:36,333 --> 00:52:38,222
about the thing and they're like,
well, you don't actually, like,

668
00:52:38,523 --> 00:52:41,012
maybe you need this eventually,
but this is what you need first.

669
00:52:41,012 --> 00:52:45,422
And it sounds like exactly what
you're talking about, like, One

670
00:52:45,422 --> 00:52:49,143
of the, like easiest ones was a,
there's a company that builds,

671
00:52:49,233 --> 00:52:54,422
um, decks, uh, you know, for the
back of your house. And, um, they

672
00:52:54,422 --> 00:52:56,373
needed a website, you know, and
they came, we need a website,

673
00:52:56,378 --> 00:52:58,382
like we're not, you know, we're
not getting leads or whatever.

674
00:52:58,382 --> 00:53:02,432
And they made fancy decks and
like expensive ones for like nice

675
00:53:02,438 --> 00:53:06,137
houses and. Uh, it turned out
like, well, you, you didn't need,

676
00:53:06,197 --> 00:53:08,927
like, the, the first thing that
they needed wasn't like, people

677
00:53:08,927 --> 00:53:10,668
aren't Googling them or whatever,
you know, like they're never

678
00:53:10,668 --> 00:53:13,427
gonna like find them. What you
need is like, your neighbor gets

679
00:53:13,427 --> 00:53:17,987
a really nice deck, well, those,
like their neighbors are the ones

680
00:53:17,987 --> 00:53:22,637
that you know, that want to buy a
deck. Right? And so first thing

681
00:53:22,637 --> 00:53:26,027
they did was buy, uh, we, we
convinced 'em to get truck, like

682
00:53:26,507 --> 00:53:30,737
big, big wrap decal wraps for
their trucks so that everybody

683
00:53:30,737 --> 00:53:33,257
knows when they're getting a new
deck that like, this is the

684
00:53:33,257 --> 00:53:35,568
company that get it, you know, in
their, their business. Like

685
00:53:36,318 --> 00:53:38,568
immediately increased. You know,
it was just a small thing. It was

686
00:53:38,568 --> 00:53:41,117
like not a huge investment. It
was just like five or something,

687
00:53:41,117 --> 00:53:46,713
you know. And I, and eventually
we did website you know, but at

688
00:53:46,713 --> 00:53:49,293
that point it was like, okay,
now, now we need to like, you

689
00:53:49,293 --> 00:53:53,913
know, but it's still, you know,
um, lots of times. My, I guess my

690
00:53:53,913 --> 00:53:57,302
point is, lots of times the
company or the, or the, in, in

691
00:53:57,302 --> 00:54:00,123
your case, the government agency
doesn't actually know exactly

692
00:54:00,128 --> 00:54:02,583
what they need. They have decided
like, there is a hole there,

693
00:54:02,643 --> 00:54:05,793
there's something wrong. But at
that, like at the point where

694
00:54:05,793 --> 00:54:09,273
they're like doing a request for
like, for, what's it called? A

695
00:54:09,782 --> 00:54:14,913
request. Something, whatever it
is, I can't remember what the

696
00:54:14,913 --> 00:54:17,882
acronym Uh, but at that point,
they're asking for the wrong

697
00:54:17,882 --> 00:54:21,722
thing lots of times, you know?
Uh, and so do I think what you,

698
00:54:21,728 --> 00:54:24,543
you've like identified this need
and it's a small thing, you know,

699
00:54:24,543 --> 00:54:28,202
it's like, it's not a huge, like,
we're gonna redo your whole, your

700
00:54:28,208 --> 00:54:30,992
whole everything, you know? Um, I
think it's a great approach.

701
00:54:32,088 --> 00:54:35,987
Jörn: I mean, we are, we are
working for like bigger companies

702
00:54:35,987 --> 00:54:40,938
that work for the government,
like. Having really big project

703
00:54:40,938 --> 00:54:45,077
for the government, you can't
really get there, get in there

704
00:54:45,077 --> 00:54:50,358
easily. So you work with other
companies that work for other

705
00:54:50,362 --> 00:54:55,038
companies that work for other
companies who do all the, or get

706
00:54:55,038 --> 00:55:01,007
the project basically. And, um,
then you find out that nobody

707
00:55:01,007 --> 00:55:05,177
really knows what, what everybody
needs, you know, like, and it's,

708
00:55:05,237 --> 00:55:11,327
it's really hard to. to, um, to
get like, so, so we are at the

709
00:55:11,327 --> 00:55:14,898
base level then talking to the
people who need to interact with

710
00:55:14,898 --> 00:55:20,657
that product. In the end, we, we
talk to them and we find out that

711
00:55:20,717 --> 00:55:25,878
they don't really know what, what
they will get because they are

712
00:55:25,878 --> 00:55:32,088
not actually involved into the
buying process. we need to find

713
00:55:32,088 --> 00:55:37,007
out what they really need in
order to make the product like

714
00:55:37,007 --> 00:55:43,068
the best fit. And, um, yeah,
sometimes it's, it's not really

715
00:55:43,068 --> 00:55:50,478
easy to say, like, okay, um, this
is going to be the, like, will it

716
00:55:50,478 --> 00:55:55,788
be the same as, as what? The
buying process basically said it

717
00:55:55,788 --> 00:56:00,737
would be or will it not? I
honestly, I, I can't always tell.

718
00:56:02,043 --> 00:56:06,963
Because I, I think sometimes you
just don't need to, to sell

719
00:56:06,963 --> 00:56:10,443
something like, like just as you
said with the tech company, I had

720
00:56:10,443 --> 00:56:15,693
a similar experience with, uh,
someone who wanted to move their

721
00:56:15,693 --> 00:56:21,702
block from a privately hosted
WordPress instance into blog

722
00:56:21,708 --> 00:56:26,913
blogger.com because he heard that
you can host on blogger.com for

723
00:56:26,913 --> 00:56:33,213
free. And he was paying 500 Euros
for his really big, uh, WordPress

724
00:56:33,213 --> 00:56:38,612
blog to some private company, and
I told him no, just move it to

725
00:56:38,612 --> 00:56:43,742
wordpress.com itself. And it will
cost like 50 bucks per month

726
00:56:43,742 --> 00:56:47,432
maybe for the traffic that you
have instead of 500. So you will

727
00:56:47,432 --> 00:56:53,043
save a lot of money and you don't
need to to get me to try and

728
00:56:53,043 --> 00:56:55,652
rebuild everything that you
already have into your

729
00:56:55,652 --> 00:57:01,652
blogger.com, something which is
really limiting your abilities

730
00:57:01,652 --> 00:57:06,978
and it's not great. But he has
heard that we were. I'm doing

731
00:57:06,983 --> 00:57:11,717
that for another, like a
satirical newspaper, which is,

732
00:57:11,777 --> 00:57:16,608
uh, quite famous in, in Germany,
which has like 300,000 visits per

733
00:57:16,608 --> 00:57:22,367
day, which is really a lot. And
um, yeah, it's hosted basically

734
00:57:22,367 --> 00:57:28,458
for free on blogger.com. It's,
yeah, the tech stack is really,

735
00:57:29,108 --> 00:57:35,867
is Theus. There's their content.
But it worked And I, I told them

736
00:57:35,867 --> 00:57:40,038
like, no, I'm, I'm not going to
work for you. You, you move to

737
00:57:40,038 --> 00:57:44,327
something else and just save
money there and don't do that.

738
00:57:44,387 --> 00:57:49,188
And I think that builds trust.
That is the trust that they will

739
00:57:49,188 --> 00:57:54,137
tell other people that if I ever
really need something, then I'll

740
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:56,027
come back to you anyways. So.

741
00:57:56,853 --> 00:57:59,583
Dan: Absolutely. And there's
like, if he's lucky that he came

742
00:57:59,588 --> 00:58:01,563
to you first, cuz there, I'm sure
there's plenty of people that

743
00:58:01,563 --> 00:58:04,532
will, that would just say, okay,
well cool blogger.com, the client

744
00:58:04,532 --> 00:58:06,782
asked me to do this. Here's my,
here's my invoice. You know what

745
00:58:06,782 --> 00:58:07,563
I mean? And

746
00:58:07,682 --> 00:58:08,043
Jörn: Yeah.

747
00:58:08,523 --> 00:58:10,413
Dan: you know, um, so I think,

748
00:58:10,472 --> 00:58:13,242
Jörn: And then they will say
what? That much

749
00:58:13,713 --> 00:58:14,492
Dan: Right, right.

750
00:58:16,353 --> 00:58:16,842
Jörn: Yeah.

751
00:58:16,862 --> 00:58:16,922
Bekah: All

752
00:58:17,702 --> 00:58:20,862
Dan: hand type. Oh, sorry. I was
just continuing on the joke. It's

753
00:58:21,182 --> 00:58:22,103
okay. I'm, I'm done.

754
00:58:22,592 --> 00:58:27,333
Bekah: make you not be funny. So,
um, all right, before we wrap up,

755
00:58:27,333 --> 00:58:31,143
I've got two more questions for
you. And the first one is, what

756
00:58:31,143 --> 00:58:33,452
is one word that describes you

757
00:58:35,268 --> 00:58:35,838
Jörn: Optimistic.

758
00:58:36,603 --> 00:58:42,213
Bekah: optimistic? Oh, I like it.
And how do you think that's

759
00:58:42,213 --> 00:58:44,853
impacted your journey to where
you are?

760
00:58:47,237 --> 00:58:52,757
Jörn: Well, um, with every
failure. Failure or every failed

761
00:58:52,757 --> 00:59:00,318
attempt to something, I could
just. Get back up and, uh, work

762
00:59:00,318 --> 00:59:01,878
through it, I guess. So

763
00:59:03,708 --> 00:59:07,097
Bekah: great. Well, thanks so
much Jörn for being with us here

764
00:59:07,097 --> 00:59:08,387
today and sharing your story.

765
00:59:09,677 --> 00:59:10,938
Jörn: Thank you for having me.

766
00:59:11,472 --> 00:59:12,273
Dan: Thanks hearing

767
00:59:13,097 --> 00:59:14,748
Jörn: was a experience.

768
00:59:19,302 --> 00:59:19,793
Dan: Yeah.

769
00:59:26,672 --> 00:59:29,402
Jörn: Well, you, you should
handle your expectations, right?

770
00:59:29,402 --> 00:59:33,782
You be low. So you are always
like, happy If something good

771
00:59:33,932 --> 00:59:38,943
have thought of that. If I would
say, say like, Hey, this is the

772
00:59:38,943 --> 00:59:43,322
best thing I ever did, and then
something negative comes along my

773
00:59:43,322 --> 00:59:46,503
way, then I can't be optimistic
anymore. So

774
00:59:47,027 --> 00:59:47,447
Dan: So true,

775
00:59:49,427 --> 00:59:53,148
Bekah: there. You heard it first.
All

776
00:59:53,418 --> 00:59:53,958
Dan: All right.

777
00:59:54,268 --> 00:59:55,228
Bekah: We'll talk to you soon.

778
00:59:55,367 --> 00:59:55,867
Dan: Bye Jörn!

779
00:59:56,043 --> 00:59:57,932
