their

9
00:00:20,077 --> 00:00:22,987
coding journey. And they're here

00:00:22,987 --> 00:00:24,502
stories and what they've
learned. And we're here to share

had a great time hanging out

14
00:00:32,445 --> 00:00:33,794
with

15
00:00:33,795 --> 00:00:37,426
Jessica Wilkins. Jessica is a
self-taught developer and staff

16
00:00:37,426 --> 00:00:39,345
author for the FreeCodeCamp news
publication. Jessica talked

17
00:00:39,345 --> 00:00:41,264
about

18
00:00:41,295 --> 00:00:44,115
how to get started with tech
writing, how to differentiate

19
00:00:44,115 --> 00:00:46,635
between constructive criticism
and negative feedback. And how

20
00:00:46,635 --> 00:00:49,155
to

21
00:00:49,155 --> 00:00:53,716
avoid things like gatekeeping in
your tech writing by eliminating

22
00:00:53,746 --> 00:00:57,886
assumptions about your audience.
And avoiding terms, like

23
00:00:58,305 --> 00:01:01,786
"it's so easy" and "just do
this." she gave some tips,

24
00:01:01,786 --> 00:01:04,695
like adding a prerequisites to
your posts or, other

25
00:01:04,725 --> 00:01:10,635
resources. Basically, Outlined
her entire process for

26
00:01:10,665 --> 00:01:13,846
all of her tech writing that she
does. And, she does a lot of

27
00:01:13,846 --> 00:01:16,995
it and it's all pretty awesome.
it was a really great

28
00:01:17,025 --> 00:01:19,906
conversation and I know you were
going to enjoy it.

29
00:01:20,287 --> 00:01:22,867
Bekah: We start every episode of
the podcast. Like we start every

30
00:01:22,867 --> 00:01:25,987
Virtual Coffee. We introduce
ourselves with our name, where

31
00:01:25,987 --> 00:01:27,832
we're from, what we do and a
random check-in question. We

32
00:01:27,832 --> 00:01:29,677
hope

33
00:01:29,677 --> 00:01:35,105
you enjoy this episode. [music]
My name is Bekah. I am a front

34
00:01:35,105 --> 00:01:40,533
end

35
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:44,222
developer from a small town in
Ohio, and my favorite childhood

36
00:01:44,222 --> 00:01:45,722
movie was Beauty and the Beast.

37
00:01:47,322 --> 00:01:51,343
Dan: That's a good one. Hi, my
name is Dan. I am a front end

38
00:01:51,343 --> 00:01:56,143
developer from Cleveland, Ohio.
And, yeah, my, my favorite

39
00:01:56,143 --> 00:01:59,173
movie is Star Wars. I think if I
had to pick one, it would,

40
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:02,352
it would be Return of the Jedi.
yeah. As, as a child, I

41
00:02:02,362 --> 00:02:06,692
watched that. just, just a lot.
So it's easy choice for me.

42
00:02:06,798 --> 00:02:07,668
Bekah: It's a solid choice.

43
00:02:08,897 --> 00:02:11,267
Jessica Wilkins: Sounds pretty
good. Hi, I am Jessica Wilkins

44
00:02:11,267 --> 00:02:13,637
and I am a

45
00:02:13,638 --> 00:02:17,418
musician learning how to code. I
am also a technical writer for

46
00:02:17,418 --> 00:02:21,948
FreeCodeCamp News. my favorite
movie was actually the Toy Story

47
00:02:21,948 --> 00:02:23,868
movies. And so the original one,
but all four of them are

48
00:02:23,868 --> 00:02:25,788
amazing there.

49
00:02:26,992 --> 00:02:27,724
Dan: Nice, those are on big
rotation at our house with, with

50
00:02:27,724 --> 00:02:28,456
our

51
00:02:28,457 --> 00:02:29,922
kids.

52
00:02:29,923 --> 00:02:32,103
We also enjoy them. They're
[crosstalk] solid.

53
00:02:32,103 --> 00:02:35,818
Jessica: I totally cried. When
Andy went to college, I bawled

54
00:02:35,848 --> 00:02:38,877
like a little baby. I'm like, oh
my gosh, he can't leave. And

55
00:02:38,877 --> 00:02:42,568
then he was giving his toys to
the little girl. I'm like, I

56
00:02:42,568 --> 00:02:43,728
mean, teary-eyed now.

57
00:02:43,728 --> 00:02:43,948
Dan: Yes.

58
00:02:44,207 --> 00:02:44,518
Jessica: ya know?

59
00:02:44,927 --> 00:02:45,897
Dan: I actually tried to
discourage that. That's I

60
00:02:45,897 --> 00:02:46,867
Toy Story

61
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:49,048
three. I tried to actually
discourage Toy Story 3 just

62
00:02:49,048 --> 00:02:52,298
because it. It's very good. It's
about it is emotionally,

63
00:02:52,418 --> 00:02:52,867
affecting

64
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:53,747
Jessica: Right,

65
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:54,397
Dan: absolutely.

66
00:02:54,812 --> 00:02:57,752
Bekah: my oldest is 12 and he'll
look at me and be like, are you

67
00:02:57,752 --> 00:03:00,272
crying? yes.

68
00:03:00,782 --> 00:03:02,902
Jessica: It's very sad. We grew
up with Andy.

69
00:03:04,133 --> 00:03:07,492
Dan: Dude, I entertainment. Like
it takes on a whole new slant

70
00:03:07,492 --> 00:03:10,402
when, especially when you have
kids. Cause like I just find

71
00:03:10,402 --> 00:03:13,223
myself being, you know, affected
by this stuff in

72
00:03:13,223 --> 00:03:16,342
different ways, you know? And
it's like, I don't it's matter.

73
00:03:16,372 --> 00:03:16,733
It's cool.

74
00:03:17,772 --> 00:03:23,117
Bekah: It's been wild rereading
novels. I read. As like a young

75
00:03:23,117 --> 00:03:26,492
adult to my kids. I, because I
always loved young adult fiction

76
00:03:26,492 --> 00:03:29,867
and I

77
00:03:29,867 --> 00:03:35,027
always loved the young adult
character. Right. And now as a

78
00:03:35,027 --> 00:03:40,068
parent, when I read it, I with
the parents and the novels and

79
00:03:40,068 --> 00:03:42,707
I'm like, oh, they don't
understand what they're doing to

80
00:03:42,707 --> 00:03:47,867
their parents. So, yeah, it's
very different, lots of crying

81
00:03:47,867 --> 00:03:49,358
and young adult novel reading
too.

82
00:03:49,358 --> 00:03:53,043
Dan: Yeah. at some point I
realized it with Calvin and

83
00:03:53,043 --> 00:03:56,342
Hobbes. I was a big Calvin and
Hobbes fan Growing up and found

84
00:03:56,342 --> 00:03:59,492
myself recently, you know,
identifying much more with

85
00:04:02,052 --> 00:04:02,962
the parents. Anyway,

86
00:04:03,872 --> 00:04:05,372
Bekah: Welcome. Jessica it's so
great to have you here with

87
00:04:05,372 --> 00:04:06,872
us

88
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:09,437
today, because we did a lunch
and learn recently with Jessica

89
00:04:09,437 --> 00:04:12,002
and

90
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:13,412
we'll put the link to that in
the show notes. And she did such

91
00:04:13,412 --> 00:04:14,822
a

92
00:04:14,823 --> 00:04:17,298
good job about talking us
through writing and writing

93
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:19,773
career. And

94
00:04:19,802 --> 00:04:23,072
it is our monthly challenge this
month, every month we hold a

95
00:04:23,072 --> 00:04:26,492
monthly challenge, in the
community is welcome to do it.

96
00:04:26,492 --> 00:04:30,468
And this is. The one-year
anniversary of when we started

97
00:04:30,468 --> 00:04:34,098
monthly challenges. And so it's
one of my favorites. It's the

98
00:04:34,098 --> 00:04:38,148
blog writing challenge and it's
based off of NaNoWriMo national

99
00:04:38,148 --> 00:04:44,867
novel writing month. And so
Jessica is just an amazing

100
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:51,017
writer. And we kicked off the
blogging challenge and our goal

101
00:04:51,017 --> 00:04:55,757
was hit 50,000 words. That's
what, as a community, that's

102
00:04:55,757 --> 00:04:57,062
what it was last year. We didn't
quite make it. We almost made

103
00:04:57,062 --> 00:04:58,367
it,

104
00:04:58,968 --> 00:05:01,158
but this year in, today is
Tuesday, November 9th. We have

105
00:05:01,158 --> 00:05:03,348
already

106
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:06,408
have we? where are we at? We're
past halfway.

107
00:05:06,947 --> 00:05:10,367
Jessica: I think we're at
27,000, I think. Yeah.

108
00:05:10,908 --> 00:05:13,307
Bekah: and largely in part due
to Jessica

109
00:05:13,408 --> 00:05:15,452
Dan: Yep. Over well, over
28,000. Yeah.

110
00:05:15,577 --> 00:05:16,208
Jessica: Oh, cool. cool.

111
00:05:17,148 --> 00:05:18,857
Bekah: So extra happy to have
you here to talk about this

112
00:05:18,857 --> 00:05:20,566
challenge

113
00:05:20,567 --> 00:05:24,197
with us. But before we jump into
that, we always like to get your

114
00:05:24,197 --> 00:05:28,487
origin story and you have a
awesome one. So tell us a little

115
00:05:28,487 --> 00:05:32,517
bit about how you got to this
point in your career.

116
00:05:33,127 --> 00:05:36,603
Jessica: Yeah. it's definitely
unique there. So I grew up in

117
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:38,147
Southern California. I grew up
in a town called Palm Springs,

118
00:05:38,147 --> 00:05:39,691
which

119
00:05:39,692 --> 00:05:42,212
is like two hours south of Los
Angeles in California there.

120
00:05:42,212 --> 00:05:44,732
And,

121
00:05:44,793 --> 00:05:47,297
grew up with a single mom who
was a teacher. And so. I

122
00:05:47,297 --> 00:05:49,801
got

123
00:05:49,802 --> 00:05:54,213
into a music pretty early at
seven, and then just kind of

124
00:05:54,213 --> 00:05:56,822
stuck with it. And it pretty
early on, I decided I'm going to

125
00:05:56,822 --> 00:06:00,632
be a professional musician. and
so I started with piano and

126
00:06:00,632 --> 00:06:02,597
then I at 11 started learning
the oboe, which is like a

127
00:06:02,597 --> 00:06:04,562
woodwind

128
00:06:04,562 --> 00:06:08,642
instrument. And I. At first
didn't really like it. Cause I

129
00:06:08,642 --> 00:06:09,752
didn't sound that good at it,
[chuckles]

130
00:06:10,577 --> 00:06:10,757
Dan: Yeah.

131
00:06:10,923 --> 00:06:12,182
Jessica: then I started to kind
of get into it. I was like,

132
00:06:12,182 --> 00:06:13,441
okay,

133
00:06:13,442 --> 00:06:15,723
cool. So then I started doing
like festivals and private

134
00:06:15,723 --> 00:06:19,202
lessons and all that fun stuff.
And I decided like 15, I'm going

135
00:06:19,202 --> 00:06:21,482
to go, try to go to music school
or conservatory. And go down

136
00:06:21,482 --> 00:06:23,762
that

137
00:06:23,762 --> 00:06:27,273
route and be a classical
professional musician. and so,

138
00:06:27,273 --> 00:06:31,142
when I graduated from college or
from high school, I went on to

139
00:06:31,353 --> 00:06:33,348
Eastman School of Music, which
is in Rochester, New York,

140
00:06:33,348 --> 00:06:35,343
and

141
00:06:35,343 --> 00:06:39,002
study there for four years on
oboe performance. And then I

142
00:06:39,033 --> 00:06:42,093
graduated and went on to a
Master's at University of

143
00:06:42,093 --> 00:06:44,683
Michigan, which is in Ann Arbor.
and then after that, I decided

144
00:06:44,683 --> 00:06:47,273
to

145
00:06:47,312 --> 00:06:50,478
Southern California because the
cold was just not agreeing with

146
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:52,353
me. So after six years of really
cold weather, I was like, no

147
00:06:52,353 --> 00:06:54,228
hard

148
00:06:54,228 --> 00:06:58,517
pass. Let's go back to Southern
California. So I came back and

149
00:06:58,608 --> 00:07:00,828
decided that I wanted to start
my own sheet music company and

150
00:07:00,828 --> 00:07:03,048
run

151
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:08,362
that. And then also, perform and
freelance and so. from

152
00:07:08,362 --> 00:07:14,723
2015 to 2020, all I did was
perform and record and run my

153
00:07:14,723 --> 00:07:18,413
sheet music company and teach.
And so I was kind of busy with

154
00:07:18,413 --> 00:07:21,068
all that fun stuff. And then
2020 happened and everything

155
00:07:21,068 --> 00:07:23,723
[chuckles] changed.

156
00:07:23,723 --> 00:07:28,642
So for everybody, but me, it was
just okay, go home. And there's

157
00:07:28,642 --> 00:07:32,028
no work for you. and I'm like
Great. So what am I supposed to

158
00:07:32,028 --> 00:07:36,317
do now? So I just worked on the
business and try to keep that

159
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:38,612
going and afloat and changing
there, for a few months. But

160
00:07:38,612 --> 00:07:40,667
then

161
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:45,617
in June of 2020, you know, US
was going through a lot with

162
00:07:45,648 --> 00:07:50,377
COVID and then race relations
with the George Floyd murder And

163
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:54,093
so a lot of people were talking
about diversity issues within

164
00:07:54,093 --> 00:07:56,913
many industries, including
myself, right? My industry with

165
00:07:56,913 --> 00:07:58,547
the classical world of operas
and orchestras, cause there's a

166
00:07:58,547 --> 00:08:00,181
huge

167
00:08:00,182 --> 00:08:02,282
diversity problem, with, with
black representation,

168
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:04,382
especially.

169
00:08:04,382 --> 00:08:06,427
And so people were asking me.
Yeah. Can you give me

170
00:08:06,427 --> 00:08:08,472
information

171
00:08:08,473 --> 00:08:10,797
about composers I can learn
about so we can start to change.

172
00:08:10,797 --> 00:08:13,121
And I

173
00:08:13,122 --> 00:08:15,103
decided there should be a
website. Like there should just

174
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:18,673
be one place where people can
find all this stuff. I, I was

175
00:08:18,673 --> 00:08:20,443
like, well, maybe could build
it. I've never built anything.

176
00:08:20,443 --> 00:08:22,213
I've

177
00:08:22,213 --> 00:08:23,878
never coded before, but Hey,
we've got all this time, so

178
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,543
maybe

179
00:08:25,543 --> 00:08:27,717
we'll learn and see what
happens. So that's how I got

180
00:08:27,717 --> 00:08:29,891
into

181
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:33,942
programming and been doing this
for about a year and a half now.

182
00:08:34,543 --> 00:08:37,137
Yeah, so that's kind of my
origin story and how I got into,

183
00:08:37,137 --> 00:08:39,731
where

184
00:08:39,732 --> 00:08:40,182
I'm at now.

185
00:08:41,633 --> 00:08:44,023
Bekah: That's so awesome. Does
that site still exist out there?

186
00:08:44,842 --> 00:08:46,987
Jessica: Yes, so I created,
version one about six months

187
00:08:46,987 --> 00:08:49,132
into

188
00:08:49,133 --> 00:08:52,432
my learning and it's called the
Black Excellence Music Project.

189
00:08:52,913 --> 00:08:58,222
And I built that with HTML, CSS,
and Vanilla JavaScript. and then

190
00:08:58,222 --> 00:09:02,898
I revisited it a few months ago,
over the summer of 2021

191
00:09:03,768 --> 00:09:07,067
create a version two, which was
built with React and Tailwind

192
00:09:07,067 --> 00:09:11,597
CSS, and has more artists and
more games and all of this fun

193
00:09:11,597 --> 00:09:13,487
stuff. and yeah, so this was
always like a passion project.

194
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:15,377
And so I

195
00:09:15,378 --> 00:09:19,508
got into tech I wanted to switch
careers. I thought initially in

196
00:09:19,508 --> 00:09:22,187
June I was like, oh, this thing
will just blow over eventually.

197
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:25,158
And I go back to my old life and
yeah. Obviously not what

198
00:09:25,158 --> 00:09:29,957
happened. I wildly miss,
understood how COVID works. I

199
Bekah: same

200
00:09:31,005 --> 00:09:32,388
Dan: everyone did.

201
totally thought this was just
going to be like a couple of

202
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,918
months and I was completely
wrong. So, but, and then I ended

203
00:09:36,918 --> 00:09:40,727
up starting to get developer
work, and that was kinda

204
00:09:40,758 --> 00:09:44,238
cool. And then I started writing
for FreeCodeCamp, which was also

205
00:09:44,238 --> 00:09:45,828
kind of cool. and I was like,
well, maybe I could have a

206
00:09:45,828 --> 00:09:47,418
career

207
00:09:47,418 --> 00:09:49,128
there. So yeah.

208
00:09:49,648 --> 00:09:55,148
Bekah: That is so awesome. So,
that project is an open

209
00:09:55,148 --> 00:09:56,018
source project, right?

210
00:09:56,548 --> 00:10:00,268
Jessica: Yes. Yeah. Yeah. And so
it's available on my personal

211
00:10:00,268 --> 00:10:03,148
GitHub, but it's completely open
source. It's a, anybody could

212
00:10:03,148 --> 00:10:04,423
like dive in there and if they
want to contribute there, I'm

213
00:10:04,423 --> 00:10:05,698
pretty

214
00:10:05,698 --> 00:10:08,248
open

215
00:10:08,248 --> 00:10:09,957
to that. So, yeah.

216
00:10:10,327 --> 00:10:12,847
Bekah: Right. It is really
awesome. And again, those links

217
00:10:12,847 --> 00:10:21,243
will be in the show notes I just
think seem like. So driven

218
00:10:21,243 --> 00:10:25,773
and motivated from everything
that you've talked about your

219
00:10:25,982 --> 00:10:27,902
career as a musician, you know,
at 15 years old, you decided

220
00:10:27,902 --> 00:10:29,822
that

221
00:10:29,822 --> 00:10:34,743
you were going to do this thing,
and that's not an easy thing. So

222
00:10:34,743 --> 00:10:38,192
you have this, I don't know,
Tenacity or, or something. How

223
00:10:38,192 --> 00:10:42,722
would you kind of describe that,
that that's allowed you to go

224
00:10:42,722 --> 00:10:45,373
through these different things
and accomplish so much.

225
00:10:45,913 --> 00:10:50,253
Jessica: I think that's in large
part to both my mom and my

226
00:10:50,253 --> 00:10:54,302
grandmother. And so both of them
were single parents. And so one

227
00:10:54,302 --> 00:10:56,522
was by choice. my mom, worked as
a teacher for many

228
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:58,742
years and

229
00:10:58,743 --> 00:11:01,442
then in her forties decided that
she wanted to adopt and have a

230
00:11:01,442 --> 00:11:04,712
child. and so, she had me when
she was like 44 or 45.

231
00:11:04,712 --> 00:11:07,982
And

232
00:11:07,982 --> 00:11:12,452
then with my grandmother, she
was married, but it was

233
00:11:12,452 --> 00:11:15,332
unfortunately an abusive
situation. So she had to get out

234
00:11:15,332 --> 00:11:19,263
and get to safety and raise two
kids by herself and was also a

235
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:22,052
teacher. but then went on to,
you know, own land in

236
00:11:22,052 --> 00:11:24,841
certain

237
00:11:24,842 --> 00:11:27,107
parts of California and just be
fiercely independent. and so I

238
00:11:27,107 --> 00:11:29,372
just

239
00:11:29,373 --> 00:11:31,952
kind of picked up on that, where
if they decided they were going

240
00:11:31,952 --> 00:11:33,902
to do something, they just went
for it. Growing up with that

241
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:35,852
type

242
00:11:35,852 --> 00:11:37,307
of mindset and energy, it's
like, well, I guess That's just

243
00:11:37,307 --> 00:11:38,762
what we

244
00:11:38,763 --> 00:11:42,312
do here. If you just want to go
do something. so when I

245
00:11:42,513 --> 00:11:46,863
discovered my love for operas
and orchestra and this weird,

246
00:11:46,863 --> 00:11:48,438
beautiful instrument of the
oboe, I was like, I want to go

247
00:11:48,438 --> 00:11:50,013
do that

248
00:11:50,552 --> 00:11:54,633
I want to go achieve that. And
so I just went for it definitely

249
00:11:54,633 --> 00:11:56,943
didn't think I was going to get
in to. The conservatory I was,

250
00:11:56,943 --> 00:11:59,253
but it

251
00:11:59,253 --> 00:12:04,173
ended up working out thankfully,
but leading up to it cause I got

252
00:12:04,383 --> 00:12:06,643
four rejections and then the
last one was an exception into

253
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,903
my

254
00:12:08,903 --> 00:12:11,673
dream schools. So at first I was
like, well maybe I'm just not

255
00:12:11,673 --> 00:12:15,423
going to college. I have four
rejections from other schools.

256
00:12:15,663 --> 00:12:19,232
But then at the very end I was
accepted, to Eastman. And

257
00:12:19,232 --> 00:12:21,423
that was the last school I heard
back from. And I was like, okay,

258
00:12:21,423 --> 00:12:23,702
cool. I guess we're going. And
we're going to my dream school.

259
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:24,633
So that worked out.

260
00:12:26,368 --> 00:12:28,318
Dan: awesome. Oh, the oboe is an
interesting choice. What,

261
w- w- do you have any reason why,
like, what made you like lean

262
00:12:33,057 --> 00:12:35,427
towards the oboe, I know from,
you know, I, I know it's very

263
00:12:35,427 --> 00:12:37,587
hard to learn and all of that
stuff. I was just curious about

264
00:12:37,587 --> 00:12:37,768
that.

265
00:12:38,538 --> 00:12:40,638
Jessica: yeah so I didn't
actually choose it.

266
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:41,388
Dan: Sure.

267
00:12:42,347 --> 00:12:44,282
Jessica: I didn't choose it.
Yeah. I was learning piano

268
00:12:44,282 --> 00:12:46,217
in

269
00:12:46,217 --> 00:12:48,134
elementary school, and then I
tried to pick up trumpet. But

270
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:50,051
That

271
00:12:50,143 --> 00:12:52,993
definitely was not the right fit
for me. I couldn't really make

272
00:12:52,993 --> 00:12:56,562
any type of sounds, but I wanted
to be in band because all my

273
00:12:56,562 --> 00:13:00,913
friends were in band and I loved
music. so I asked the, band

274
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:03,102
director at the middle school
and I told him, I said, Hey, I'm

275
00:13:03,102 --> 00:13:06,263
really passionate. I want to
learn something. his answer was,

276
00:13:06,283 --> 00:13:10,182
you should learn the oboe. And
I'm like, Okay. what is that? He

277
00:13:10,182 --> 00:13:13,383
was like here. And so he got out
and oboe and he got out of reed

278
00:13:14,143 --> 00:13:16,355
he put it together for me and
put it, he said, okay, this is.

279
00:13:16,355 --> 00:13:18,567
You

280
00:13:18,567 --> 00:13:20,112
know, blow and just how you make
an embouchure. And I did that

281
00:13:20,112 --> 00:13:21,657
and

282
00:13:21,658 --> 00:13:23,998
it squeaked, he's like perfect.
You should be our new oboe

283
00:13:23,998 --> 00:13:28,158
player. I was like, Okay, cool.
And I'm like 11 years old, so

284
00:13:28,158 --> 00:13:30,242
I've just game for anything. And
he probably totally planned

285
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:32,326
that.

286
00:13:32,327 --> 00:13:35,878
Like, yes, we got another one
because oboe's so rare in

287
00:13:35,927 --> 00:13:41,057
schools, along with like basoon.
So that's when he heard that I

288
00:13:41,057 --> 00:13:43,427
was, I just wanted to join and
he's like, cool. Let's just talk

289
00:13:43,427 --> 00:13:47,408
her into playing this thing. And
we're all taken care of, but I

290
00:13:47,418 --> 00:13:49,998
guess I have to thank him for it
because I ended up falling in

291
00:13:49,998 --> 00:13:50,957
love with it. So.

292
00:13:51,727 --> 00:13:52,867
Dan: Yeah, that's awesome. Yeah,
I imagine there was, there was

293
00:13:52,867 --> 00:13:54,007
no

294
00:13:54,008 --> 00:13:55,508
oboe player, you know, before he
started.

295
00:13:56,107 --> 00:13:57,832
Jessica: Yeah, there was
actually just one, but then he

296
00:13:57,832 --> 00:13:59,557
was like,

297
00:13:59,557 --> 00:14:02,242
we really need one other one.
And so it was easy to talk at 11

298
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:04,927
year

299
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:07,148
old, because at that age, you're
just like, I just want to do

300
00:14:07,148 --> 00:14:09,908
anything and you're not going to
like fight it there, so.

301
00:14:10,113 --> 00:14:12,932
Bekah: My oldest is learning the
trombone because someone gave us

302
00:14:12,932 --> 00:14:13,773
a free trombone.

303
00:14:14,337 --> 00:14:15,477
Jessica: see, there you go.
Yeah, exactly. That's how, like

304
00:14:15,477 --> 00:14:16,617
most

305
00:14:16,618 --> 00:14:18,717
kids fall into it. They're like,
I don't know. Just give me an

306
00:14:18,717 --> 00:14:20,187
instrument. I'll figure it out.

307
00:14:21,913 --> 00:14:24,567
Bekah: Yeah, that is awesome.
And so it's great to hear to

308
00:14:24,567 --> 00:14:27,221
your

309
00:14:27,312 --> 00:14:31,602
you've had this history of
teaching in your family, and it

310
00:14:31,602 --> 00:14:35,052
sounds like you also taught
music, but you're also teaching

311
00:14:35,052 --> 00:14:37,393
now through what you're doing.
You know, you did the lunch and

312
00:14:37,393 --> 00:14:39,523
learn for us and taught us all
about writing, but also as

313
00:14:39,523 --> 00:14:41,653
you're

314
00:14:41,653 --> 00:14:43,977
writing, you're teaching. So,
how much of that do you think

315
00:14:43,977 --> 00:14:46,301
that,

316
00:14:47,173 --> 00:14:51,557
you're able to lean on. What
you've learned from your mom and

317
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:56,447
your grandmother, or is it
something that you thought you

318
00:14:56,447 --> 00:14:59,238
really had to work hard to
acquire that skill?

319
00:14:59,993 --> 00:15:01,320
Jessica: Yeah, I, I you really
know when I was teaching

320
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,647
beginners, there's

321
00:15:02,647 --> 00:15:05,301
a

322
00:15:05,302 --> 00:15:09,113
lot of patience required when
you're teaching beginner

323
00:15:09,113 --> 00:15:12,232
students, especially beginner
oboist, because it's like a

324
00:15:12,273 --> 00:15:15,748
really weird instrument and
there's not a lot- Unnatural

325
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,807
things with it. And so it
requires a lot of patience and

326
00:15:18,807 --> 00:15:21,658
just saying, okay, let's just
take it one step at a time. And

327
00:15:21,658 --> 00:15:25,498
so I think that translates a lot
into the articles I write. Now I

328
00:15:25,498 --> 00:15:29,697
write a lot of beginner articles
on HTML and CSS and JavaScript

329
00:15:29,697 --> 00:15:34,018
and tutorials and all that fun
stuff. And so I know what it's

330
00:15:34,018 --> 00:15:35,812
like. First start out in
programming. And I think a lot

331
00:15:35,812 --> 00:15:37,606
of

332
00:15:37,607 --> 00:15:39,707
writers just skip over stuff
[chuckles] and they'll skip like

333
00:15:39,707 --> 00:15:41,807
20 steps when

334
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:44,118
they're writing about something
and they'll go, oh yeah, first

335
00:15:44,118 --> 00:15:47,057
you do this. And then when you
log in, just take care of this

336
00:15:47,057 --> 00:15:49,008
and then go over here and I'm
like, wait, wait, wait a minute.

337
00:15:49,008 --> 00:15:52,638
Like, how is a beginner supposed
to kind of fill in those gaps?

338
00:15:52,638 --> 00:15:55,248
And so I really try to be
conscious about explaining

339
00:15:55,248 --> 00:15:57,362
things, not assuming anything,
being patient there, I think

340
00:15:57,362 --> 00:15:59,476
that

341
00:15:59,477 --> 00:16:02,055
goes into my writing. Cause I
just want to help people as

342
00:16:02,055 --> 00:16:04,633
best

343
00:16:04,633 --> 00:16:05,293
as I can.

344
00:16:07,102 --> 00:16:12,077
Bekah: That's so important
because the, it. It really helps

345
00:16:12,077 --> 00:16:17,658
to create a more welcoming and
inclusive space in tech to have.

346
00:16:19,067 --> 00:16:21,572
Tutorials or guides or articles
that don't make assumptions

347
00:16:21,572 --> 00:16:24,077
about

348
00:16:24,077 --> 00:16:25,239
the people who are reading them.
Because I can't tell you how

349
00:16:25,239 --> 00:16:26,401
many times

350
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,727
I

351
00:16:28,727 --> 00:16:31,007
started reading something and
got very frustrated because I

352
00:16:31,007 --> 00:16:33,287
was

353
00:16:33,288 --> 00:16:37,812
following the steps. But it
wasn't working and I didn't know

354
00:16:37,812 --> 00:16:41,863
what to do or what to look for.
And that can be really hard to

355
00:16:41,863 --> 00:16:45,582
navigate through, especially if
you're self-taught or you don't

356
00:16:45,582 --> 00:16:50,173
have a good support system. So I
really appreciate hearing you

357
00:16:50,173 --> 00:16:53,592
talk about making sure that
that's part of your process.

358
00:16:54,753 --> 00:16:58,038
Jessica: Yeah. Yeah. Cause it's
just like the person came to

359
00:16:58,038 --> 00:17:01,727
learn. And so when you're just
skipping steps or saying, oh,

360
00:17:01,758 --> 00:17:03,032
what are the things too? That's
a pet peeve is when people say,

361
00:17:03,032 --> 00:17:04,306
oh,

362
00:17:04,307 --> 00:17:05,417
it's so easy. You just do this.
You can't say that. [Chuckles]

363
00:17:05,417 --> 00:17:06,527
Like a lot

364
00:17:06,527 --> 00:17:08,747
of

365
00:17:08,748 --> 00:17:10,788
people do this when they're
setting up, like gitHub for the

366
00:17:10,788 --> 00:17:14,242
first time and they'll say, oh
yeah, This up and you just run

367
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:16,403
these commands, just open up
your, your. terminal. It's

368
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:19,252
totally fine. And, and there you
go. And it's like, no, it's not

369
00:17:19,252 --> 00:17:22,583
totally fine. This is brand new
for a lot of people. So you've

370
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,643
got to walk through those steps
and throw in some screenshots

371
00:17:26,303 --> 00:17:27,997
make sure that people can follow
along. Cause it might be easy

372
00:17:27,997 --> 00:17:29,691
for

373
00:17:29,692 --> 00:17:30,877
somebody that's been doing it
for many, many years, but when

374
00:17:30,877 --> 00:17:32,062
you're

375
00:17:32,063 --> 00:17:34,613
first learning it, you're going,
wait, where's my terminal.

376
00:17:34,613 --> 00:17:36,307
Where's my command prompt. How
do I type, do I type this in

377
00:17:36,307 --> 00:17:38,001
first

378
00:17:38,002 --> 00:17:40,313
and then do this? Or this is
very confusing. So.

379
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,228
Bekah: Yeah, I'll never forget.
[crosstalk] It's one of the

380
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:43,623
first times I

381
00:17:43,623 --> 00:17:45,662
paired with somebody is somebody
that I really like admired in

382
00:17:45,662 --> 00:17:47,701
the

383
00:17:47,702 --> 00:17:51,542
industry. And I was terrified
because I didn't know. And at

384
00:17:51,542 --> 00:17:56,012
that point I hadn't really been
using. VS Code or, or

385
00:17:56,012 --> 00:18:01,952
anything like that. And so okay,
can you open up a text

386
00:18:01,952 --> 00:18:06,843
editor? And I had no idea what
that word meant. And so I opened

387
00:18:06,843 --> 00:18:09,152
up Google docs and, they like,
kind of went with it. And then

388
00:18:09,152 --> 00:18:11,461
eventually

389
00:18:11,462 --> 00:18:15,313
they were like, do you have
something like VS Code or Atom.

390
00:18:16,232 --> 00:18:19,390
oh, that's a text editor. like,
Things like that, you know, I

391
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:22,548
didn't

392
00:18:22,577 --> 00:18:22,718
know.

393
00:18:22,718 --> 00:18:22,807
Jessica: Right.

394
00:18:22,877 --> 00:18:27,528
Bekah: I hadn't seen it written
before and I was using built-in,

395
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:30,782
things with the lessons that I
was learning. And I remember

396
00:18:30,782 --> 00:18:32,657
just

397
00:18:32,657 --> 00:18:37,278
that sense of shame that didn't
belong there. Right. I shouldn't

398
00:18:37,278 --> 00:18:41,357
be ashamed in that moment, but
when you feel like there are

399
00:18:41,373 --> 00:18:45,633
assumptions like, oh, I should
have known that. And it's not

400
00:18:45,633 --> 00:18:49,623
true. So to have people breaking
things down to avoid, that makes

401
00:18:49,623 --> 00:18:52,472
it much easier for people to
keep learning.

402
00:18:53,673 --> 00:18:57,442
Jessica: Yeah, exactly. Cause I
mean, people want to learn and,

403
00:18:57,442 --> 00:19:00,363
and I think writing is just such
an important skill. I think

404
00:19:00,363 --> 00:19:02,537
everybody should write and work
on writing. And, and I think

405
00:19:02,537 --> 00:19:04,711
there's

406
00:19:04,712 --> 00:19:07,353
just two levels. There's writing
technical articles and then

407
00:19:07,353 --> 00:19:10,113
there's also writing about your
personal story. And so the cool

408
00:19:10,113 --> 00:19:13,113
thing about this monthly
challenge is I get to do both is

409
00:19:13,113 --> 00:19:15,722
I get to focus on some technical
stuff and then I get to talk

410
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:17,867
about, some yo weird stories I
have some fun articles coming up

411
00:19:17,867 --> 00:19:20,012
there

412
00:19:20,012 --> 00:19:21,782
and just kind of sharing my
story there.

413
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:26,940
Dan: Yeah, I think that's
awesome. That balance of, of,

414
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,797
you

415
00:19:29,798 --> 00:19:34,448
know, not making assumptions
about your audience and, but

416
00:19:34,448 --> 00:19:35,618
also still kind of getting your
point across for the thing

417
00:19:35,618 --> 00:19:36,788
you're

418
00:19:36,788 --> 00:19:40,278
trying to learn is, is a, is a
hard balance to strike and I

419
00:19:40,278 --> 00:19:44,387
think you do it well. there, is
there anything. If somebody was

420
00:19:44,387 --> 00:19:46,727
starting a technical article,
you know, I mean, w- what advice

421
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:49,067
would

422
00:19:49,067 --> 00:19:50,897
you give? Like, you know, say
the thing that I wanted to learn

423
00:19:50,897 --> 00:19:52,727
or

424
00:19:52,728 --> 00:19:56,657
that I wanted to, you know,
teach, had required to GitHub,

425
00:19:56,657 --> 00:19:59,117
you know, required you to check
out a repository and all of that

426
00:19:59,117 --> 00:20:03,887
stuff. you say, like, would you
suggest putting all that stuff

427
00:20:03,887 --> 00:20:09,093
step-by-step in or linking to.
Articles about, you know, about

428
00:20:09,093 --> 00:20:10,982
how to do that and that kind of
thing. Like what, what kind of

429
00:20:10,982 --> 00:20:13,202
approach, you know, generally
would you would you suggest?

430
00:20:13,538 --> 00:20:17,438
Jessica: Yeah. So I think it's
fine if there's. if you want

431
00:20:17,438 --> 00:20:20,327
to Link an article, or if you
want to have a right at the very

432
00:20:20,327 --> 00:20:23,778
top of your articles, just say,
prerequisites must be familiar

433
00:20:23,778 --> 00:20:27,768
with and GitHub. I mean, I just
wrote an article about,

434
00:20:27,798 --> 00:20:31,067
how to work with Node and
NodeMailer for emails. And so I

435
00:20:31,067 --> 00:20:33,857
had a prerequisite say, okay,
I'm not going to cover basic

436
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:37,688
JavaScript. So it's important.
That you understand some of the

437
00:20:37,688 --> 00:20:40,538
basic concepts and the basics
behind nodes. So we can dive

438
00:20:40,538 --> 00:20:42,623
straight into this. And there
was one section where there's a

439
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:44,708
different

440
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:48,847
setup with how to do Google with
NodeMailer and set up all the,

441
00:20:49,688 --> 00:20:52,448
off the authentication there.
And so I did link to another

442
00:20:52,448 --> 00:20:54,938
FreeCodeCamp article and say,
okay, here's a detailed

443
00:20:54,968 --> 00:20:57,518
step-by-step process. If you're
going to use google with

444
00:20:57,518 --> 00:21:00,428
NodeMailer, otherwise you could
walk through the steps that I'm

445
00:21:00,428 --> 00:21:02,768
going to show you here. So I
think that's completely fine.

446
00:21:03,067 --> 00:21:06,893
There were, if you feel like you
could write through. All of

447
00:21:06,893 --> 00:21:09,952
those steps in the article, I
think either approach works

448
00:21:09,952 --> 00:21:12,563
there. But I, I think it's
healthy to have like a

449
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:16,222
prerequisites if necessary, just
to let everybody know, Hey, if

450
00:21:16,252 --> 00:21:19,192
you don't have these
prerequisites, that is going to

451
00:21:19,192 --> 00:21:22,432
be kind of hard to follow,
especially for some of the

452
00:21:22,432 --> 00:21:25,853
tutorials, because I see a lot
of people have FreeCodeCamp, go

453
00:21:25,853 --> 00:21:29,482
through a lot of our Python
tutorials, which assume you have

454
00:21:29,482 --> 00:21:31,434
some basic knowledge, but
they're not acknowledging that

455
00:21:31,434 --> 00:21:33,386
you have,

456
00:21:33,478 --> 00:21:36,807
that basic knowledge. And so
they'll come to the forum and

457
00:21:36,807 --> 00:21:39,057
they'll go, how do I do this? Or
why does it say I have an

458
00:21:39,057 --> 00:21:41,518
indentation error? And so we'll
tell them, like, you're doing

459
00:21:41,518 --> 00:21:42,613
crazy things with your
indentation. You can't do that

460
00:21:42,613 --> 00:21:43,708
in

461
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:46,948
Python, but they won't know that
because they just started coding

462
00:21:46,978 --> 00:21:50,278
Python like two days ago. And
they're trying to build like a

463
00:21:50,278 --> 00:21:54,143
Discord bot. And so just a
properly communicating. Like,

464
00:21:54,143 --> 00:21:58,613
this is not necessarily a
beginner or if it is like, some

465
00:21:58,613 --> 00:22:00,098
walkthrough steps that you can
go through. Here's a great

466
00:22:00,098 --> 00:22:01,583
article

467
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:04,853
that lays it out. so I, I think
that's completely fine there.

468
00:22:04,992 --> 00:22:08,413
Dan: Ah, I love that, that,
prerequisites, you know, is, I

469
00:22:08,413 --> 00:22:09,763
think that's a great, a great
way to set expectations for the,

470
00:22:09,763 --> 00:22:11,113
you

471
00:22:11,113 --> 00:22:12,388
know, for the article. Right.
And then you don't get down

472
00:22:12,388 --> 00:22:13,663
three

473
00:22:13,663 --> 00:22:15,002
paragraphs in and become totally
lost Assuming you read

474
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:16,341
prerequisites, you

475
00:22:16,342 --> 00:22:19,021
know?

476
00:22:19,048 --> 00:22:22,288
Jessica: Yeah. Yeah. I try to
make it obvious, you know? a

477
00:22:22,288 --> 00:22:23,488
heading, like here you go.

478
00:22:23,823 --> 00:22:24,262
Dan: Right, right.

479
00:22:25,198 --> 00:22:26,682
Jessica: So if someone misses
it, it's like, okay, well, I did

480
00:22:26,682 --> 00:22:28,166
try

481
00:22:28,167 --> 00:22:28,557
to warn you.

482
00:22:28,962 --> 00:22:31,373
Dan: Yeah, exactly. I think
that's great advice. Yeah.

483
00:22:33,587 --> 00:22:37,097
Bekah: Yeah, I think too, it's
almost a really good convention

484
00:22:37,127 --> 00:22:39,887
to build into something so I
could see, Like software

485
00:22:39,887 --> 00:22:42,647
that

486
00:22:42,647 --> 00:22:47,928
hosts tech blogging, like, tech
blogging platforms. be

487
00:22:47,928 --> 00:22:50,433
really nice if that was built
in. what are the prerequisites?

488
00:22:50,433 --> 00:22:52,938
And

489
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:56,508
then you can click the thing or
you can add the thing then that

490
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:59,327
way it already, everybody knows
where they should look for Okay.

491
00:22:59,327 --> 00:23:02,146
This

492
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:05,238
is what I need to know. I don't
know those things. And it also

493
00:23:05,238 --> 00:23:07,562
puts it in the writer's mind
that it makes it obvious to them

494
00:23:07,562 --> 00:23:09,886
to

495
00:23:09,887 --> 00:23:15,657
think about. It makes it a
deliberate decision to recognize

496
00:23:15,657 --> 00:23:18,162
who their audience is and what
they should already know coming

497
00:23:18,162 --> 00:23:20,667
into

498
00:23:20,667 --> 00:23:24,178
this. So I think like from both
perspectives, it would be really

499
00:23:24,178 --> 00:23:29,127
useful in helping us to have
these conversations about, what

500
00:23:29,127 --> 00:23:32,577
content is usable, usable for
different audiences.

501
00:23:33,762 --> 00:23:35,457
Jessica: Right. And then there's
some tutorials where people

502
00:23:35,457 --> 00:23:37,152
label

503
00:23:37,153 --> 00:23:39,613
it beginner, but it's clearly
isn't beginner. I'm like, I

504
00:23:39,613 --> 00:23:42,073
don't

505
00:23:42,073 --> 00:23:44,188
think beginners or I wasn't
doing that. I was first starting

506
00:23:44,188 --> 00:23:46,303
out.

507
00:23:46,932 --> 00:23:50,952
And so sometimes people really
mislabel, which hurts beginners,

508
00:23:50,982 --> 00:23:53,143
and then they're going through
it. They're like, well, how do I

509
00:23:53,143 --> 00:23:55,553
do this? I was like, well, maybe
we start off with something a

510
00:23:55,553 --> 00:23:58,330
little bit easier if that's
okay. So yeah, so sometimes

511
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:01,107
people, I

512
00:24:01,147 --> 00:24:02,887
think a lot of it has to do
with, they forget what it's like

513
00:24:02,887 --> 00:24:04,627
to be

514
00:24:04,627 --> 00:24:05,198
a beginner

515
00:24:05,198 --> 00:24:05,288
Dan: Yes.

516
00:24:05,288 --> 00:24:07,597
Jessica: or they rewrite history
and they're like, oh, I was

517
00:24:07,597 --> 00:24:09,262
totally doing this when I was
first learning in six months or

518
00:24:09,262 --> 00:24:10,927
a

519
00:24:10,928 --> 00:24:15,008
year. And it's like, no, you
probably weren't. You probably

520
00:24:15,008 --> 00:24:18,248
just forgot you weren't doing
those types of things. Cause I

521
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:19,940
think the first few months.
Going through a FreeCodeCamp and

522
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,632
going

523
00:24:21,643 --> 00:24:25,323
through the certifications, but
I didn't understand how HTML CSS

524
00:24:25,323 --> 00:24:27,782
and JavaScript work together. I
was just like, okay, there's

525
00:24:27,782 --> 00:24:30,992
these things like arrays and
objects, but how do I make a

526
00:24:30,992 --> 00:24:33,452
webpage? So I just didn't
understand how everything

527
00:24:33,452 --> 00:24:38,643
connected. and so beginners,
it's, it's a lot of information

528
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,457
and it's just like fire hose.
And so you just have to make

529
00:24:40,457 --> 00:24:42,271
sure

530
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:45,242
that you're not making
assumptions going, oh yeah, you

531
00:24:45,242 --> 00:24:48,212
could totally do this with your
beginner. And it's like, no. you

532
00:24:48,212 --> 00:24:51,528
gotta break that down there.
That's definitely not a beginner

533
00:24:51,528 --> 00:24:54,468
tutorial. Let's label it
intermediate at best there.

534
00:24:55,512 --> 00:24:57,142
Dan: Yeah, absolutely. And you
know, to your point. People

535
00:24:57,142 --> 00:24:58,772
could

536
00:24:58,772 --> 00:25:00,972
forget, you know, the, what it
feels like to be a beginner

537
00:25:00,972 --> 00:25:03,172
at

538
00:25:03,173 --> 00:25:04,648
it from experience. It's very
easy to forget that, you know,

539
00:25:04,648 --> 00:25:06,123
it

540
00:25:06,123 --> 00:25:07,753
takes effort to that in
practice. I'm sure. You know, it

541
00:25:07,753 --> 00:25:09,383
becomes,

542
00:25:09,823 --> 00:25:11,392
easier. but, yeah, it's, it's
hard to, it's hard

543
00:25:11,392 --> 00:25:12,961
sometimes to

544
00:25:12,962 --> 00:25:14,752
put yourself back in. know, once
you're a few years into a

545
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:16,542
career,

546
00:25:16,903 --> 00:25:20,863
to put yourself back into spot,
you know, the like total

547
00:25:20,863 --> 00:25:21,792
utter confusion,

548
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:23,238
Jessica: Right. Exactly.

549
00:25:23,532 --> 00:25:24,792
Dan: like, I, I can't remember
it, you know, if I, if I make

550
00:25:24,792 --> 00:25:26,052
my,

551
00:25:26,173 --> 00:25:29,053
like, if I think about it, I can
remember it, you know? And I was

552
00:25:29,053 --> 00:25:29,922
at the same boat. I'm like,
well, I'm writing, you see him

553
00:25:29,922 --> 00:25:30,791
out

554
00:25:30,792 --> 00:25:32,247
here. I'm like, and I was
writing like PHP at the same

555
00:25:32,247 --> 00:25:33,702
time. Like I

556
00:25:33,702 --> 00:25:34,536
was like learning it all at the
same time and tottally didn't

557
00:25:34,536 --> 00:25:35,370
understand how

558
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:37,038
they

559
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:38,253
all connected. And, you know,
somebody sent me a CSS file.

560
00:25:38,253 --> 00:25:39,468
He's

561
00:25:39,468 --> 00:25:42,798
like instead of using whatever
use this. And I'm like, well,

562
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:44,928
here's a bunch of black magic.
I'm just going to drop into my

563
00:25:44,928 --> 00:25:46,622
like... into my program.
apparently it works, you know,

564
00:25:46,622 --> 00:25:48,316
it

565
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:53,147
it's, yeah, it can be a, a hard
thing to, to remember, but

566
00:25:53,208 --> 00:25:54,498
an important thing for sure.

567
00:25:55,863 --> 00:25:57,272
Bekah: So I want to back up a
little bit because I feel like

568
00:25:57,272 --> 00:25:58,681
we

569
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:01,442
miss this very impart important
part of the story of. You

570
00:26:01,442 --> 00:26:04,202
started

571
00:26:04,202 --> 00:26:07,482
learning to code and suddenly
you're writing for FreeCodeCamp.

572
00:26:07,502 --> 00:26:10,113
Like that's not something little
right.

573
00:26:10,163 --> 00:26:11,573
Jessica: totally glossed over
that. Yeah.

574
00:26:12,452 --> 00:26:13,412
Bekah: That's a major
accomplishment. So I don't want

575
00:26:13,412 --> 00:26:14,372
to lose that. so tell

576
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:16,292
us,

577
00:26:16,482 --> 00:26:17,853
how did that happen?

578
00:26:18,323 --> 00:26:20,182
Jessica: Yes, it's a crazy
story, but that's kind of my

579
00:26:20,182 --> 00:26:22,041
life. But

580
00:26:22,042 --> 00:26:25,942
what ends up happening is around
October of 2020, or actually

581
00:26:25,942 --> 00:26:29,663
September of 2020, I decided to
join the FreeCodeCamp forum

582
00:26:29,663 --> 00:26:31,057
because like a lot of
self-taught developers, you kind

583
00:26:31,057 --> 00:26:32,451
of bounce

584
00:26:32,452 --> 00:26:34,312
around different. Resources, and
then you try to find one

585
00:26:34,312 --> 00:26:36,172
that

586
00:26:36,173 --> 00:26:38,393
works. And so I did a few
different things before

587
00:26:38,393 --> 00:26:41,482
FreeCodeCamp, but then I landed
on FreeCodeCamp. I was like, I

588
00:26:41,482 --> 00:26:43,147
kinda like this. Okay, cool. So
I started going through, the

589
00:26:43,147 --> 00:26:44,812
first

590
00:26:44,813 --> 00:26:48,232
certification, which is on HTML
and CSS and responsive design.

591
00:26:48,728 --> 00:26:51,847
And so I decided to just sign up
for the forum. I was like, maybe

592
00:26:51,847 --> 00:26:54,407
I could connect with some
beginners that be kind of cool.

593
00:26:54,518 --> 00:26:56,153
And some other developers just
talk with them. And so I

594
00:26:56,153 --> 00:26:57,788
originally,

595
00:26:57,788 --> 00:26:59,917
I just thought I would just kind
of hang in the background and

596
00:26:59,917 --> 00:27:03,488
maybe jump in once in a while,
but I ended up jumping in a lot

597
00:27:03,488 --> 00:27:06,938
more and answering questions or
just giving my perspective and

598
00:27:06,938 --> 00:27:09,817
sharing my story. And so after
about a month of being on the

599
00:27:09,817 --> 00:27:13,667
forum, Quincy reached out to me
and he was like, Hey, you're

600
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:17,448
super active and what's your
story? Let's talk. And so we set

601
00:27:17,448 --> 00:27:20,718
up a Google Meet we talked for
about like 45 minutes, and we

602
00:27:20,718 --> 00:27:23,897
just talked about his background
coming from a teacher into tech

603
00:27:23,897 --> 00:27:27,617
and then my background with
music. And he decided, he said,

604
00:27:27,708 --> 00:27:32,057
well, you should join our forum
moderator team and start writing

605
00:27:32,057 --> 00:27:35,988
for FreeCodeCamp as a volunteer.
Okay. I don't know what to write

606
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:37,998
about. Cause I've just been
doing this for like two seconds

607
00:27:37,998 --> 00:27:40,008
and he

608
00:27:40,008 --> 00:27:43,307
said, just share your story. And
I'm like, oh, I could do that.

609
00:27:43,307 --> 00:27:46,607
That sounds fun. So I decided to
just write a few posts about my

610
00:27:46,607 --> 00:27:49,607
story so I wrote one, my first
one was about what I enjoyed

611
00:27:49,607 --> 00:27:51,332
about being a beginner. And I
wrote one article about the

612
00:27:51,332 --> 00:27:53,057
parallels

613
00:27:53,057 --> 00:27:58,008
between music and. learning code
and programming.

614
00:27:58,188 --> 00:28:02,327
And then that was noticed by
Gatsby and they were like, Hey,

615
00:28:02,327 --> 00:28:03,932
we have this blog and do you
want to write it? We'll pay you.

616
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,537
I was

617
00:28:05,538 --> 00:28:08,597
like, yeah, that sounds fun to
me. So that I wrote about

618
00:28:08,597 --> 00:28:10,157
imposter syndrome and how I
dealt with it as a musician and

619
00:28:10,157 --> 00:28:11,717
how.

620
00:28:12,188 --> 00:28:14,798
Yeah, it goes in with
programming. so now all of a

621
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:19,057
sudden I start writing articles
and just sharing my story. And

622
00:28:19,057 --> 00:28:20,452
after a few months of doing
that, Quincy comes back to me

623
00:28:20,452 --> 00:28:21,847
and says,

624
00:28:22,087 --> 00:28:24,817
well, I've got another
proposition for you. do you

625
00:28:24,817 --> 00:28:27,938
want to start writing technical
articles and we'll pay you per

626
00:28:27,938 --> 00:28:32,538
article? And I was like, ah, I
don't think I could do that. So

627
00:28:32,538 --> 00:28:36,048
originally I actually said no
very politely, because I just

628
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:37,038
didn't think I could do that.
Cause at this point this was

629
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:38,028
like

630
00:28:38,028 --> 00:28:42,468
six months in and we're at the
same time I had started my first

631
00:28:42,468 --> 00:28:45,258
developer job, but I was still
kind of overwhelmed with that. I

632
00:28:45,258 --> 00:28:46,577
was working part-time at this
small company. And so I was

633
00:28:46,577 --> 00:28:47,896
like,

634
00:28:47,968 --> 00:28:51,637
I don't know if I'm qualified to
write technical articles, like

635
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:55,488
who is going to believe me. I, I
don't know what I'm doing. And.

636
00:28:55,978 --> 00:28:58,768
He said, well, I, I think you
can, I think you really good at

637
00:28:58,768 --> 00:29:03,327
just breaking down concepts and
could pick articles you feel

638
00:29:03,327 --> 00:29:06,958
comfortable with. And so he had
this whole Trello board,

639
00:29:06,988 --> 00:29:10,498
topics and I could just choose
which ones I felt comfortable

640
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:13,377
with. So I picked all the HTML,
CSS, ones, I think maybe a

641
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:17,127
couple of JavaScript ones, and
just started from there. And

642
00:29:17,127 --> 00:29:20,488
so a few months of just writing
and getting paid per article on

643
00:29:20,488 --> 00:29:26,137
my own schedule and, around
July. It was interesting

644
00:29:26,167 --> 00:29:29,887
because I was deciding if I
actually wanted this to be a

645
00:29:29,887 --> 00:29:33,728
full-time career or not. And, an
opportunity came up with

646
00:29:33,728 --> 00:29:38,428
Disney for a music job, but I
ended up turning that down to

647
00:29:38,428 --> 00:29:39,458
pursue software

648
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:40,617
Dan: Wow.

649
00:29:40,907 --> 00:29:44,347
Jessica: Yeah. Which is a whole
other story in of itself, which

650
00:29:44,347 --> 00:29:46,077
we could cover. But, but yeah,
so then I was like, okay,

651
00:29:46,077 --> 00:29:47,807
I

652
00:29:47,807 --> 00:29:51,518
guess we're going into software
now I turned down that job and

653
00:29:51,518 --> 00:29:54,087
then Quincy reached out again,
said, Hey, I've got a job for

654
00:29:54,087 --> 00:29:58,337
you. I want you to join my team
officially you know, be,

655
00:29:58,397 --> 00:29:59,807
writing all the time. I was
like, okay, cool. So it's funny

656
00:29:59,807 --> 00:30:01,217
how

657
00:30:01,218 --> 00:30:03,333
life works out, where one door
closes and then another one

658
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:05,448
opens

659
00:30:05,448 --> 00:30:09,988
around. I started officially in
August of 2021. Writing

660
00:30:09,988 --> 00:30:13,057
articles and being part of the
author team. And so there's a

661
00:30:13,057 --> 00:30:16,077
total of four of us. And we all
come from very diverse

662
00:30:16,077 --> 00:30:17,862
backgrounds and we're located
all around the world. but he'll

663
00:30:17,862 --> 00:30:19,647
now

664
00:30:19,647 --> 00:30:22,647
assign us articles. And so he'll
send us like 10 or 12 different

665
00:30:22,647 --> 00:30:25,252
headlines at a time. And then.
we just write. basically we

666
00:30:25,252 --> 00:30:27,857
research

667
00:30:27,857 --> 00:30:31,127
and write. So right now I have a
whole bunch of SQL

668
00:30:31,127 --> 00:30:32,912
articles and I've been learning
about that and just writing

669
00:30:32,912 --> 00:30:34,697
about

670
00:30:35,387 --> 00:30:38,837
SQL basically as Well, as a few
more JavaScript articles that I

671
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,798
have leftover that I need to
write about. But Yeah. that's,

672
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:45,468
that's kinda my story. How I, my
weird story, how I wound up at

673
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:46,288
FreeCodeCamp.

674
00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:48,692
Dan: Oh, Thats great. Yeah. And
you actually answered it at the

675
00:30:48,692 --> 00:30:51,032
end of a question I was going to
ask was, you know, how to

676
00:30:51,032 --> 00:30:54,393
balance, like, if you're, if
writing is, you know, your main

677
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:56,913
job, how to balance actually
learning, you know, whilst

678
00:30:56,913 --> 00:30:59,462
writing, but it sounds like kind
of built into the job, right?

679
00:30:59,788 --> 00:31:00,387
Jessica: Exactly.

680
00:31:00,522 --> 00:31:01,262
Dan: very cool.

681
00:31:01,357 --> 00:31:03,557
Jessica: Cause there's times
where I'll get assigned articles

682
00:31:03,557 --> 00:31:03,617
Dan: Yeah.

683
00:31:03,617 --> 00:31:05,548
Jessica: and I'm like, okay, I
feel comfortable about this. And

684
00:31:05,548 --> 00:31:08,488
then there's times where I'm
like, I've never really worked

685
00:31:08,488 --> 00:31:13,107
with this. So I guess I'll have
to learn it because I have to

686
00:31:13,107 --> 00:31:16,048
write about it and convince
people that I know what I'm

687
00:31:16,048 --> 00:31:17,562
talking about there, but it's
really great because I get to,

688
00:31:17,562 --> 00:31:19,076
we

689
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:21,215
all have that, where we are. One
of the authors was asked to

690
00:31:21,215 --> 00:31:23,353
learn

691
00:31:23,593 --> 00:31:26,502
some PHP and writes a PHP
articles. Another one was asked

692
00:31:26,502 --> 00:31:30,492
to write C, C++, and learn that.
we're all down for just

693
00:31:30,492 --> 00:31:32,427
learning, whatever we need to
learn and get the job done

694
00:31:32,427 --> 00:31:34,362
there.

695
00:31:35,962 --> 00:31:36,893
Bekah: I love that much.

696
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:37,333
Dan: That's Awesome

697
00:31:38,018 --> 00:31:38,678
Bekah: Sorry, go ahead.

698
00:31:39,538 --> 00:31:41,847
Dan: That was my whole thing.
That was awesome. That sounds

699
00:31:41,847 --> 00:31:42,208
awesome.

700
00:31:43,538 --> 00:31:45,293
Bekah: I just kind of want to
sum up your whole timeline here

701
00:31:45,293 --> 00:31:47,048
of

702
00:31:47,048 --> 00:31:48,995
everything that's happened
before. I think that for a lot

703
00:31:48,995 --> 00:31:50,942
of

704
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:54,962
people that we talked to,
especially people who are trying

705
00:31:54,962 --> 00:31:57,617
to transition into a tech
career, it's where to get start.

706
00:31:57,617 --> 00:32:00,272
And

707
00:32:00,303 --> 00:32:02,373
first of all, like get
comfortable with being

708
00:32:02,373 --> 00:32:07,952
uncomfortable, but also. You
finding that spot, you had this

709
00:32:07,952 --> 00:32:11,173
opportunity because you
participated on FreeCodeCamp

710
00:32:11,192 --> 00:32:14,313
because they reached out to you
because they saw like, look,

711
00:32:14,343 --> 00:32:16,713
Jessica is awesome and she's
here and she's contributing.

712
00:32:16,713 --> 00:32:19,083
that just

713
00:32:19,083 --> 00:32:21,407
progressively led to more and
bigger and better things. And

714
00:32:21,407 --> 00:32:23,731
so,

715
00:32:23,883 --> 00:32:26,223
you know, start with telling
your story and, writing those

716
00:32:26,223 --> 00:32:28,563
words

717
00:32:28,563 --> 00:32:31,792
and this. You know, that's
largely been my blogging

718
00:32:31,792 --> 00:32:36,442
experience. I rarely write very
technical things because just

719
00:32:36,442 --> 00:32:41,093
want to get the words out on
paper, or it's not on paper, but

720
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:46,063
put, put it out there into the
world and that's a good place to

721
00:32:46,182 --> 00:32:46,603
start.

722
00:32:47,222 --> 00:32:50,012
Jessica: Yeah. I mean, there's,
everybody has a story and

723
00:32:50,012 --> 00:32:53,192
everybody has something to talk
about and share. And so just,

724
00:32:53,192 --> 00:32:56,163
just share with people and you'd
be surprised who reaches out. I

725
00:32:56,163 --> 00:32:57,783
mean, that's how I got my first
developer job is I wasn't

726
00:32:57,783 --> 00:32:59,403
looking

727
00:32:59,403 --> 00:33:02,282
for a job. I didn't think I was
anywhere close to being ready,

728
00:33:02,492 --> 00:33:04,712
but this guy found me on the
forum. He's like, Hey, I'm

729
00:33:04,712 --> 00:33:07,798
looking for a junior. Yeah. A
junior in what?

730
00:33:09,208 --> 00:33:12,597
Jessica: you want me to write
code for you? And so he's like,

731
00:33:12,597 --> 00:33:16,738
yeah. And, I still work with him
to this day and it's been an

732
00:33:16,738 --> 00:33:20,367
incredible learning experience,
but that came out of just being

733
00:33:20,367 --> 00:33:23,548
active on the forum and just,
know, writing and talking about

734
00:33:23,548 --> 00:33:24,298
my story there.

735
00:33:24,729 --> 00:33:27,489
Bekah: Sorry. I was like, my
brain is split in two different

736
00:33:27,489 --> 00:33:29,693
directions of where to go here.
I'm a, Dan is you want to

737
00:33:29,693 --> 00:33:31,897
add

738
00:33:31,898 --> 00:33:34,298
something before I take us off
on a tangent?

739
00:33:34,743 --> 00:33:37,023
Dan: Nope. I would say pick the
left one.

740
00:33:37,513 --> 00:33:41,473
Bekah: The left one. Okay. My
left one was, thinking about

741
00:33:41,473 --> 00:33:45,973
your, and literally in my mind,
it was, it was on the left. your

742
00:33:45,973 --> 00:33:47,398
career goals. I don't know if
you have career goals, but does,

743
00:33:47,398 --> 00:33:48,823
is

744
00:33:48,824 --> 00:33:50,309
writing something that you want
to continue to do? Do you want

745
00:33:50,309 --> 00:33:51,794
to

746
00:33:51,794 --> 00:33:57,344
pursue, the writing aspect of
coding or, or find yourself

747
00:33:57,344 --> 00:33:59,383
somewhere in the middle or just
see this as part of a tangent of

748
00:33:59,383 --> 00:34:01,422
your

749
00:34:01,493 --> 00:34:01,953
journey?

750
00:34:02,538 --> 00:34:06,949
Jessica: Yeah. Yeah. I would
like to have at one point a, a

751
00:34:06,949 --> 00:34:10,128
traditional, like full-time
developer job, but I definitely

752
00:34:10,128 --> 00:34:11,478
still want to keep writing. And
so if there's any way I can

753
00:34:11,478 --> 00:34:12,828
still

754
00:34:12,829 --> 00:34:16,369
be involved, especially with
FreeCodeCamp, and still write

755
00:34:16,369 --> 00:34:18,093
articles for them in some sort
of capacity. Cause I just, I, I

756
00:34:18,093 --> 00:34:19,817
love

757
00:34:19,818 --> 00:34:23,031
to write it. I love. Teach
people and help out wherever I

758
00:34:23,031 --> 00:34:26,244
can. but

759
00:34:26,244 --> 00:34:27,758
they think the bigger career
goal too, is I have all these

760
00:34:27,758 --> 00:34:29,272
ideas

761
00:34:29,273 --> 00:34:31,658
for music related, tech that I
want to build. And some of

762
00:34:31,658 --> 00:34:34,043
them

763
00:34:34,043 --> 00:34:35,928
are crazy ideas. And I mean, I
guess all my ideas are crazy,

764
00:34:35,928 --> 00:34:37,813
but

765
00:34:38,054 --> 00:34:39,083
Bekah: are my favorite.

766
00:34:39,153 --> 00:34:40,453
Jessica: I guess That's the
entrepreneurship in me where

767
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:41,753
it's

768
00:34:41,753 --> 00:34:43,378
like, oh, my ideas are insane,
but I just don't want to let

769
00:34:43,378 --> 00:34:45,003
them

770
00:34:45,003 --> 00:34:45,443
go.

771
00:34:45,503 --> 00:34:45,824
Dan: Those are

772
00:34:45,824 --> 00:34:47,508
Jessica: the best ones And so.
Exactly. So, yeah, so that's

773
00:34:47,508 --> 00:34:49,192
like

774
00:34:49,193 --> 00:34:52,943
the long-term goal is to start
slowly tackling some of these

775
00:34:52,943 --> 00:34:57,623
ideas and just kind of go from
there and work a regular

776
00:34:57,623 --> 00:34:59,498
developer job, but then also
keep writing and have fun with

777
00:34:59,498 --> 00:35:01,373
it.

778
00:35:02,753 --> 00:35:07,463
Bekah: Yeah, that gives me an
idea for a monthly challenge, I

779
00:35:07,463 --> 00:35:09,728
think we have a big energy
channel in Slack. And a lot of

780
00:35:09,728 --> 00:35:11,993
it

781
00:35:11,994 --> 00:35:19,494
is just GIF's, to bring us big
energy. But I really think

782
00:35:19,494 --> 00:35:22,434
that so many of us have these
big ideas that we think are

783
00:35:22,434 --> 00:35:24,038
unattainable, or this is too
big, or this is too out there.

784
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:25,642
Right.

785
00:35:25,884 --> 00:35:31,494
Or there's just too many of them
like on one. if there was a big

786
00:35:31,494 --> 00:35:34,943
idea month, right? Like we all
write down all of our big ideas

787
00:35:34,943 --> 00:35:37,148
that we want to share. And work
together to kind of give

788
00:35:37,148 --> 00:35:39,353
feedback

789
00:35:39,353 --> 00:35:40,868
on those big ideas and figure
out like where to focus or how

790
00:35:40,868 --> 00:35:42,383
to

791
00:35:42,384 --> 00:35:44,048
break things down. And then, you
know, that way, like together,

792
00:35:44,048 --> 00:35:45,712
we

793
00:35:45,713 --> 00:35:48,893
have that support, but we're,
we're making progress on the

794
00:35:48,893 --> 00:35:51,143
things that we really enjoy
doing it.

795
00:35:52,153 --> 00:35:53,728
Jessica: Exactly. I mean, I
think ideas are fun and playing

796
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:55,303
around

797
00:35:55,304 --> 00:35:58,184
with them and then trying to
implement them. And sometimes

798
00:35:58,184 --> 00:36:00,103
people will call you crazy. I
mean, people thought I was nuts

799
00:36:00,344 --> 00:36:03,764
to try to do a publishing
company. I remember I went to an

800
00:36:03,764 --> 00:36:07,523
alumni event. And I was just
started with the business and I,

801
00:36:07,523 --> 00:36:10,344
you know, you go around and does
events and you talk to small

802
00:36:10,344 --> 00:36:11,649
groups of people, and it was
some sort of administrator with

803
00:36:11,649 --> 00:36:12,954
the

804
00:36:12,954 --> 00:36:17,304
university of Rochester. And she
was asking me what my next plans

805
00:36:17,304 --> 00:36:19,268
were. I said, well, you know, I
just moved here to LA and

806
00:36:19,268 --> 00:36:21,232
looking

807
00:36:21,233 --> 00:36:24,353
for freelance work, but I also
have this sheet music business

808
00:36:24,353 --> 00:36:26,278
that he just got started and she
was. Why I'm like, oh, okay.

809
00:36:26,278 --> 00:36:28,203
Well,

810
00:36:29,403 --> 00:36:33,333
let me tell you why that was a
little taken aback. I was like,

811
00:36:33,333 --> 00:36:35,448
okay, great. Well, this

812
00:36:35,448 --> 00:36:37,563
conversation won't last long,

813
00:36:37,563 --> 00:36:40,324
so I had a few people. They're
just like, why would you, why

814
00:36:40,324 --> 00:36:42,401
would you do that? But I just
had a very specific. Vision of

815
00:36:42,401 --> 00:36:44,478
what I

816
00:36:44,478 --> 00:36:46,548
wanted with my sheet music
business. And then people were

817
00:36:46,548 --> 00:36:47,913
surprised that it actually
turned into a business. I'm

818
00:36:47,913 --> 00:36:49,278
like, well,

819
00:36:49,309 --> 00:36:52,639
yeah, I told her I was going to
do that. You didn't believe me.

820
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:56,748
And so, yeah, I think sometimes
people will just reject it and

821
00:36:56,748 --> 00:36:58,458
then once they see it come true
and they're like, oh, okay. I

822
00:36:58,458 --> 00:37:00,168
see

823
00:37:00,168 --> 00:37:02,778
it there. I mean, the same thing
happened with, with Disney where

824
00:37:02,778 --> 00:37:04,233
people thought he was nuts to
build a park in Anaheim where

825
00:37:04,233 --> 00:37:05,688
all

826
00:37:05,688 --> 00:37:07,553
these orange trees were and
then. Obviously that worked out

827
00:37:07,553 --> 00:37:09,418
for

828
00:37:09,418 --> 00:37:11,113
him, but initially people
thought he was just completely

829
00:37:11,113 --> 00:37:12,808
nuts. Like

830
00:37:12,809 --> 00:37:16,378
who's going to go to this park
and where is Anaheim and Well,

831
00:37:16,409 --> 00:37:17,429
people were wrong there.

832
00:37:20,003 --> 00:37:21,844
Bekah: Well, I love that
confidence that you talk It with

833
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:23,199
too. You're like, yeah, I'm
going to do this thing because I

834
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,534
want

835
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:28,043
to do it. And it's a good idea.
And at some point, people start

836
00:37:28,043 --> 00:37:32,003
to buy into that idea because of
how you present it and the

837
00:37:32,003 --> 00:37:33,803
confidence that you use. And,
oh, you're just like, love how

838
00:37:33,803 --> 00:37:35,603
chill

839
00:37:35,603 --> 00:37:37,664
you are when you talk about
things. I'm like, oh yeah, yeah.

840
00:37:37,673 --> 00:37:40,824
I would definitely work with
Jessica on that, you know?

841
00:37:42,068 --> 00:37:44,818
Jessica: I just like going for
things cause it's like, Yeah, it

842
00:37:44,818 --> 00:37:46,203
either works out or it doesn't
it. And if it doesn't work out,

843
00:37:46,203 --> 00:37:47,588
I

844
00:37:47,588 --> 00:37:50,318
learned something. I had plenty
of things that didn't work out,

845
00:37:50,708 --> 00:37:52,628
I'm glad I tried it. So I could
at least learn along the way,

846
00:37:52,628 --> 00:37:54,548
but

847
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:57,759
sometimes you just gotta go for
it. You can't really play safe

848
00:37:57,789 --> 00:38:00,438
and, and, you know what to do
too risky. You don't want to go

849
00:38:00,438 --> 00:38:01,963
like bankrupt or anything crazy,
but like, you know, you just

850
00:38:01,963 --> 00:38:03,488
want

851
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:07,583
to. If you have an idea and you
feel really confident about it,

852
00:38:07,583 --> 00:38:09,954
just, just go for it and take it
one step at a time. There.

853
00:38:10,929 --> 00:38:13,748
Dan: Yeah, it's a theme. That's
come up a few times on the

854
00:38:13,748 --> 00:38:16,889
podcast that, you know, it makes
me think of a Structured YOLO.

855
00:38:16,989 --> 00:38:20,528
Nick Taylor, which is a phrase
he, he coined, you know,

856
00:38:20,528 --> 00:38:22,073
but it's the same sort of idea,
right? It's is. You know, I

857
00:38:22,073 --> 00:38:23,618
mean,

858
00:38:25,059 --> 00:38:27,998
don't want to go full YOLO,
right. But the

859
00:38:28,074 --> 00:38:28,614
Jessica: Exactly.

860
00:38:28,778 --> 00:38:29,659
Dan: structured YOLO. Yeah,

861
00:38:29,693 --> 00:38:30,563
Jessica: the way out there. I

862
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:30,918
Dan: yeah,

863
00:38:31,103 --> 00:38:31,224
Jessica: my

864
00:38:31,228 --> 00:38:32,139
Bekah: little bit of YOLO.

865
00:38:32,588 --> 00:38:32,918
Dan: yeah,

866
00:38:32,934 --> 00:38:35,213
Jessica: my business, I wasn't
like, okay, cool. Let's just

867
00:38:35,213 --> 00:38:37,224
raise all this money. No, that
would have been crazy. Cause I

868
00:38:37,224 --> 00:38:38,423
was like young, 20 something
year old had didn't know what

869
00:38:38,423 --> 00:38:39,622
they

870
00:38:39,623 --> 00:38:41,138
were doing. Excited to take
small little steps to get there.

871
00:38:41,138 --> 00:38:42,653
I

872
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:46,673
couldn't go that big and do some
crazy fundraising goal or

873
00:38:46,673 --> 00:38:49,284
whatever when I had no clue what
I was doing. So.

874
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:54,219
Dan: Absolutely. But the, know,
the willingness to have an idea

875
00:38:54,219 --> 00:38:59,048
that is not what a normal, I
guess, whenever, you know, idea

876
00:38:59,048 --> 00:39:01,028
that you might run into that
conversation with somebody like,

877
00:39:01,059 --> 00:39:03,039
well, why, why are you doing
that? You know, but the

878
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:04,988
willingness to, jump into it,
you know, and, and push

879
00:39:04,988 --> 00:39:06,937
through,

880
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:09,278
I think is, a, know, a valuable,
valuable trait to

881
00:39:09,278 --> 00:39:11,587
have,

882
00:39:11,588 --> 00:39:12,543
you know, and obviously it's
served you, served you really

883
00:39:12,543 --> 00:39:13,498
well.

884
00:39:16,043 --> 00:39:22,224
Bekah: So sometimes, it can be
really challenging to write.

885
00:39:22,989 --> 00:39:29,289
Blog posts to get started and to
receive feedback on blog posts.

886
00:39:29,318 --> 00:39:33,239
You know, whether that's from an
editor or somebody who has

887
00:39:33,628 --> 00:39:42,369
commented on your posts in a way
that is not, kind So how do

888
00:39:42,369 --> 00:39:45,838
you navigate those challenging
situations while you're writing?

889
00:39:46,489 --> 00:39:48,431
Jessica: Yeah, It's feedback is
always interesting, especially

890
00:39:48,431 --> 00:39:50,373
in

891
00:39:50,373 --> 00:39:51,768
the world of the internet
because people can just hide

892
00:39:51,768 --> 00:39:53,163
behind their

893
00:39:53,164 --> 00:39:56,043
computers and save virtually
anything to you that they

894
00:39:56,043 --> 00:39:58,923
probably wouldn't say if you
guys, if you were face-to-face

895
00:39:58,923 --> 00:40:02,824
with them, but I try to just
separate them between actual,

896
00:40:02,824 --> 00:40:06,893
constructive feedback versus. ok
this is not helpful. I'm just

897
00:40:06,893 --> 00:40:09,983
going to move on. And so I've
had, some constructive

898
00:40:09,983 --> 00:40:13,643
feedback, like, oh, this is
really good. could you like,

899
00:40:13,793 --> 00:40:17,213
you know, expand on this part or
could you talk more about this?

900
00:40:17,213 --> 00:40:18,983
And I'm like, okay. Yeah, that
makes sense. And then there's

901
00:40:18,983 --> 00:40:20,588
been times where it's like,
well, I think it would be better

902
00:40:20,588 --> 00:40:22,193
if you

903
00:40:22,193 --> 00:40:25,014
went into this. I mean, that's
what real developers do or

904
00:40:25,014 --> 00:40:27,983
whatever. So I've got like those
comments I'm like, okay, well

905
00:40:27,983 --> 00:40:32,003
you're an obviously not helpful.
And so I just learned that,

906
00:40:32,003 --> 00:40:33,558
when I was running my business,
There's just those comments

907
00:40:33,558 --> 00:40:35,113
that,

908
00:40:35,123 --> 00:40:38,923
that people just have to, you
know, just write things and

909
00:40:38,923 --> 00:40:41,864
you're just like, okay, I'm just
not going to waste my energy on

910
00:40:41,864 --> 00:40:46,003
that. It's a, luckily I haven't
had too many just absolutely

911
00:40:46,003 --> 00:40:49,063
horrific things. at least with
my programming writing,

912
00:40:49,094 --> 00:40:52,514
there was only one incident,
that I had when I was running my

913
00:40:52,574 --> 00:40:54,254
sheet music company, where there
was this guy that went out of

914
00:40:54,254 --> 00:40:55,934
his

915
00:40:55,934 --> 00:41:01,054
way. To make accounts and post
race, racist memes and stuff on

916
00:41:01,054 --> 00:41:04,324
my page and on my YouTube
channel. And I, of course I had

917
00:41:04,324 --> 00:41:06,784
to block all that, but he would
keep creating new accounts of

918
00:41:06,793 --> 00:41:08,723
like, you're that threatened by
what I'm doing, that you have to

919
00:41:08,723 --> 00:41:10,653
spend

920
00:41:10,653 --> 00:41:12,918
time. And so there are people
out there that just are that

921
00:41:12,918 --> 00:41:15,183
hateful

922
00:41:15,813 --> 00:41:19,563
that you just exist because of
your race or your gender. And

923
00:41:19,653 --> 00:41:22,474
it's just like, okay, you know,
it's a it's, it's okay to be

924
00:41:22,474 --> 00:41:24,343
human. Yeah. you know, feel that
and go, well, come on.

925
00:41:24,343 --> 00:41:26,212
Yeah.

926
00:41:26,244 --> 00:41:27,433
But at the end of the day, you
just have to remember like

927
00:41:27,433 --> 00:41:28,622
that's

928
00:41:28,643 --> 00:41:30,548
their issue, right. They they're
just a hateful person. Is he

929
00:41:30,548 --> 00:41:32,453
just

930
00:41:32,454 --> 00:41:34,673
trying to block them and move
on? and, and just focus on

931
00:41:34,673 --> 00:41:36,892
the

932
00:41:37,063 --> 00:41:38,658
helpful, constructive feedback
as well as the positive feedback

933
00:41:38,658 --> 00:41:40,253
to,

934
00:41:40,403 --> 00:41:42,623
to know that you're on the right
track, you're doing the right

935
00:41:42,623 --> 00:41:42,744
thing there.

936
00:41:44,963 --> 00:41:46,313
Bekah: Yeah, I really liked
that. And that's for a long

937
00:41:46,313 --> 00:41:47,663
time, I

938
00:41:47,693 --> 00:41:52,134
stayed away from blogging on any
platform except my own blog,

939
00:41:52,164 --> 00:41:55,929
because I didn't have comments
enabled. I couldn't see how many

940
00:41:55,929 --> 00:41:57,923
people liked it, And I still
frequently think about going

941
00:41:57,923 --> 00:41:59,917
back

942
00:41:59,918 --> 00:42:02,408
to that rather than cross
posting other places that, that

943
00:42:02,408 --> 00:42:04,898
have

944
00:42:05,349 --> 00:42:08,469
those built-in things, because
sometimes it can just, it can be

945
00:42:08,469 --> 00:42:10,719
hard or you put a lot of time
and effort into something maybe

946
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:12,969
two

947
00:42:12,969 --> 00:42:17,119
people like it versus the thing
that I, I YOLO'ed on a Saturday

948
00:42:17,139 --> 00:42:20,378
night. And then there's all of
these hits and like, what, what

949
00:42:20,378 --> 00:42:21,248
is this?

950
00:42:22,059 --> 00:42:24,998
Jessica: Yeah. I I've been there
so many times both with like

951
00:42:24,998 --> 00:42:28,179
writing technical articles then
with sheet music where I'll

952
00:42:28,179 --> 00:42:31,239
release a new product I'll be
like, oh, this is good. Totally

953
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:32,766
sell through. This is gonna be a
hit. And then. The sales are

954
00:42:32,766 --> 00:42:34,293
like

955
00:42:34,293 --> 00:42:38,134
nothing. I'm like, okay, wildly
misjudged that. And then I'll

956
00:42:38,134 --> 00:42:40,773
release another product then
like, okay, this will do okay.

957
00:42:40,773 --> 00:42:42,963
And then it ends up being a
breakout. I'm like, what

958
00:42:42,963 --> 00:42:47,193
happened? What did I misjudged?
That it's the same thing with

959
00:42:47,193 --> 00:42:49,594
writing where there'll be some
articles. Actually, this just

960
00:42:49,594 --> 00:42:53,253
happened with the CodePen and
Replit articles, because I

961
00:42:53,253 --> 00:42:54,903
decided to write those because
FreeCodeCamp up uses both of

962
00:42:54,903 --> 00:42:56,553
those

963
00:42:56,554 --> 00:42:59,998
tools, in their certifications.
There really

964
00:42:59,998 --> 00:43:04,048
should be a guide to help them
since it's based on the course.

965
00:43:04,048 --> 00:43:05,398
And I just thought, okay, well,
few people write these.

966
00:43:05,398 --> 00:43:06,748
Hopefully

967
00:43:06,748 --> 00:43:09,449
they'll just refer to them. But
then both of them were retweeted

968
00:43:09,478 --> 00:43:13,829
by the co-founders and the CEO.
And I'm like, okay, that was

969
00:43:13,858 --> 00:43:15,659
unexpected, but that's kind of
cool.

970
00:43:17,081 --> 00:43:21,608
Dan: Do you ever, like doing
tech support comments, you know,

971
00:43:21,608 --> 00:43:24,409
sections when you're writing
technical articles,

972
00:43:24,409 --> 00:43:27,568
Jessica: I do. Yeah. Yeah.
Sometimes someone's like, oh, I

973
00:43:27,568 --> 00:43:31,259
tried this example from your
article. It's not working. And

974
00:43:31,259 --> 00:43:32,308
I'm like, oh, could you write
the code? It's sometimes it's

975
00:43:32,308 --> 00:43:33,357
hard.

976
00:43:33,358 --> 00:43:36,329
Cause like Twitter and stuff,
it's not really good for writing

977
00:43:36,329 --> 00:43:37,319
code, but I'm like, I don't
know, just try your best or take

978
00:43:37,319 --> 00:43:38,309
a

979
00:43:38,309 --> 00:43:41,429
picture or something. then I'll
say, oh, you have this syntax

980
00:43:41,429 --> 00:43:43,739
error right here. If you clean
that up, that you should be good

981
00:43:43,739 --> 00:43:47,829
to go. It's a. Sometimes just
kind of, or actually this

982
00:43:47,829 --> 00:43:50,679
just happened to, with, the
NodeMailer article where they're

983
00:43:50,679 --> 00:43:53,588
like, oh, could you put this up
on, GitHub repos so we could

984
00:43:53,588 --> 00:43:55,688
study it? And I was like, oh
yeah, I should totally do that.

985
00:43:55,688 --> 00:43:57,773
Cause I had just posted the
final code in the article. and

986
00:43:57,773 --> 00:43:59,858
without

987
00:43:59,858 --> 00:44:03,548
thinking, like people would want
to study it and, you know,

988
00:44:03,548 --> 00:44:06,068
fork it and all this fun stuff.
I was like, oh yeah, we should

989
00:44:06,068 --> 00:44:10,088
probably do that. So I created a
GitHub repository and then,

990
00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:11,768
just shared it with that. But
sometimes I'll kind of

991
00:44:11,768 --> 00:44:14,018
troubleshoot with them as best
as possible. but sometimes

992
00:44:14,018 --> 00:44:16,268
their questions are vague.

993
00:44:16,298 --> 00:44:19,719
I'm like, I'm not really sure
what you're working with unless

994
00:44:19,719 --> 00:44:22,838
we like together on some sort of
zoom meet, but I don't know how

995
00:44:23,079 --> 00:44:24,369
feasible that is, but

996
00:44:26,273 --> 00:44:27,833
Bekah: yeah. that doesn't scale.
Well, I think.

997
00:44:30,639 --> 00:44:33,518
Dan: What about, so you
mentioned like code stuff like

998
00:44:33,518 --> 00:44:38,409
that. kind of, I dunno process,
or I guess I'm looking

999
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:43,313
for advice generally. if, you if
if your, article Involves a

1000
00:44:43,313 --> 00:44:45,473
lot of code and stuff like that.
Do you try to, like things

1001
00:44:45,473 --> 00:44:47,633
up

1002
00:44:47,634 --> 00:44:51,204
into little bits or make a link
to Like, you know, like you

1003
00:44:51,204 --> 00:44:53,574
mentioned, what, what kind of,
of approaches do you take

1004
00:44:53,574 --> 00:44:56,213
with, w with technical articles
and with

1005
00:44:56,994 --> 00:44:58,568
Jessica: Yeah. So for some of
the examples they're really

1006
00:44:58,568 --> 00:45:00,142
small,

1007
00:45:00,143 --> 00:45:04,494
like I just wrote one about,
JavaScript contains or includes

1008
00:45:04,494 --> 00:45:07,704
method. and so those were like
really, really small,

1009
00:45:07,824 --> 00:45:09,443
code examples in there. But then
one of my other articles

1010
00:45:09,443 --> 00:45:11,062
was

1011
00:45:11,063 --> 00:45:13,568
on the MVC pattern. And so I
kind of had to struggle with how

1012
00:45:13,568 --> 00:45:16,073
much

1013
00:45:16,074 --> 00:45:18,864
code am I going to include in
this? Cause I built an app

1014
00:45:18,864 --> 00:45:22,518
specifically to talk about that
pattern. But I thought, okay, is

1015
00:45:22,518 --> 00:45:25,969
this going to be a full
walkthrough tutorial, or am I

1016
00:45:25,969 --> 00:45:29,449
just going to give out chunks of
it? So it ended up working where

1017
00:45:29,449 --> 00:45:33,384
I said, okay, it's fine. If they
don't. Work with that particular

1018
00:45:33,384 --> 00:45:35,543
stack that I was working with
and I was working with the MERN

1019
00:45:35,543 --> 00:45:38,664
stack, but if I could just talk
about the concepts and just have

1020
00:45:38,664 --> 00:45:40,268
a few snippets of code and say,
this is what this code does.

1021
00:45:40,268 --> 00:45:41,872
Even

1022
00:45:41,873 --> 00:45:44,994
if you're not a JavaScript
developer, at least they can,

1023
00:45:45,023 --> 00:45:48,384
there's some context. And I had
the final, project there that

1024
00:45:48,384 --> 00:45:51,503
they could look at and say, oh,
okay, that's what she's doing

1025
00:45:51,503 --> 00:45:54,173
here. And so sometimes you'll
you just want to have like these

1026
00:45:54,173 --> 00:45:56,364
small little code examples
sometimes it's totally fine to

1027
00:45:56,364 --> 00:45:58,669
just link to a repository if
it's super super long. cause

1028
00:45:58,669 --> 00:46:00,974
then

1029
00:46:01,034 --> 00:46:04,034
there's that battle between
length and it's like, how much

1030
00:46:04,034 --> 00:46:08,173
are people really gonna read? If
it's super, super long, there's

1031
00:46:08,173 --> 00:46:09,718
not too many, really long
articles on FreeCodeCamp.

1032
00:46:09,718 --> 00:46:11,263
There's

1033
00:46:11,264 --> 00:46:14,474
a few that are like at 7,000
plus words. I personally haven't

1034
00:46:14,474 --> 00:46:17,331
written any of those. but I
think my longest is 20 I think

1035
00:46:17,331 --> 00:46:20,188
my

1036
00:46:20,188 --> 00:46:21,838
longest was 3000, but that ended
up just listing off all the

1037
00:46:21,838 --> 00:46:23,488
types

1038
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:25,784
of like free courses you could
take. but, yeah, I try to

1039
00:46:25,784 --> 00:46:28,079
hit

1040
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:32,789
that magic mark of like 1500, a
thousand words or less. I mean,

1041
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:35,009
if there's only so much, you
could write about some of these

1042
00:46:35,009 --> 00:46:38,849
methods where it's like, I can't
write 1500 words on the includes

1043
00:46:38,849 --> 00:46:41,248
method for JavaScript. There's
only so much you could do there

1044
00:46:42,208 --> 00:46:42,449
that.

1045
00:46:43,403 --> 00:46:44,115
Dan: Oh, that's a good note. I
mean, and that's also an

1046
00:46:44,115 --> 00:46:44,827
interesting

1047
00:46:44,828 --> 00:46:46,253
thing

1048
00:46:46,253 --> 00:46:52,539
to like of, you know, writing,
you. If you could feel

1049
00:46:52,539 --> 00:46:55,329
yourself getting like too long,
you know, it, do you try to cut

1050
00:46:55,329 --> 00:46:57,309
down or do you about splitting
it up, but, you I suppose it

1051
00:46:57,309 --> 00:46:59,289
depends

1052
00:46:59,289 --> 00:47:03,668
on what platform you're on or
Code Camp or not, or, you know,

1053
00:47:03,668 --> 00:47:05,268
but generally

1054
00:47:05,548 --> 00:47:05,728
Jessica: right. Cause

1055
00:47:05,798 --> 00:47:06,159
Dan: you know,

1056
00:47:06,344 --> 00:47:08,953
Jessica: I just joined dev.to,
week ago and, or I think I

1057
00:47:08,953 --> 00:47:11,562
joined

1058
00:47:11,563 --> 00:47:16,184
a while for Nick's VS Code tips,
and then just hadn't used it for

1059
00:47:16,184 --> 00:47:19,643
awhile then, like rejoined, I
guess. for the NodeMailer

1060
00:47:19,664 --> 00:47:22,833
article, I was like, oh, Well, I
have these ideas about how to

1061
00:47:22,833 --> 00:47:24,888
style the emails and how to,
actually, you know, deploy

1062
00:47:24,888 --> 00:47:26,943
it

1063
00:47:26,943 --> 00:47:28,068
to Heroku. But maybe we could
just break that up. That could

1064
00:47:28,068 --> 00:47:29,193
be

1065
00:47:29,193 --> 00:47:30,933
a separate article. And I like
how in DEV.to, you can link

1066
00:47:30,933 --> 00:47:32,673
to

1067
00:47:32,673 --> 00:47:35,014
like, create your own little
series and it will link all the

1068
00:47:35,014 --> 00:47:38,224
articles together. so sometimes
when you're writing something,

1069
00:47:38,224 --> 00:47:41,284
you're like, huh, I have these
other ideas. Maybe it could be

1070
00:47:41,284 --> 00:47:42,889
like, this is part one. And then
this is part two and stick

1071
00:47:42,889 --> 00:47:44,494
around

1072
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:47,253
for part three or something.
think that's totally fine. Just

1073
00:47:47,253 --> 00:47:50,164
so it doesn't become this
monster article. It's like, ah,

1074
00:47:50,699 --> 00:47:54,349
Everybody. It's the same thing
with videos. I think some of the

1075
00:47:54,349 --> 00:47:58,099
videos are super long on some of
these channels

1076
00:47:58,224 --> 00:47:58,344
Dan: Yeah.

1077
00:47:58,759 --> 00:48:00,438
Jessica: where like, if
somebody's going to sit through

1078
00:48:00,438 --> 00:48:03,679
17 hours or is that one of those
things where you just got to

1079
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:08,119
break it up into smaller bite
size videos. but I guess

1080
00:48:08,119 --> 00:48:10,518
everybody has their own learning
methods. So maybe there are

1081
00:48:10,518 --> 00:48:15,318
people that will go through a 17
hour video or, you know, 7,000.

1082
00:48:15,318 --> 00:48:17,594
Bekah: My husband used to
livestream for FreeCodeCamp. And

1083
00:48:17,903 --> 00:48:21,673
sometimes he would do it for
hours and people would stay the

1084
00:48:21,673 --> 00:48:22,233
whole time.

1085
00:48:22,273 --> 00:48:24,748
Jessica: Oh, yeah. Yeah. There's
some like, yeah. I'm just like,

1086
00:48:24,869 --> 00:48:26,099
wow, how

1087
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:30,028
Bekah: I just live stream for an
hour for the first time ever,

1088
00:48:30,028 --> 00:48:35,998
probably by myself. I was tired
of hearing myself talk, like, I

1089
00:48:35,998 --> 00:48:38,159
can't imagine how everybody else
was feeling. You know

1090
00:48:38,219 --> 00:48:38,789
Jessica: right.

1091
00:48:39,028 --> 00:48:44,199
Bekah: my attention span to die.
And then I, then I start YOLOing

1092
00:48:44,248 --> 00:48:47,849
things and it's, it's not, not
the place I want to be

1093
00:48:48,179 --> 00:48:50,384
Jessica: Right. Right. You know,
actually that reminds me, Danny

1094
00:48:50,384 --> 00:48:52,169
Thompson is one where he has
these really long Twitter

1095
00:48:52,169 --> 00:48:53,954
spaces,

1096
00:48:53,983 --> 00:48:57,134
but they're really good. So
that's why he kind of is able to

1097
00:48:57,134 --> 00:48:59,011
get away with it because for
most people. They would kind of

1098
00:48:59,011 --> 00:49:00,888
die

1099
00:49:00,889 --> 00:49:05,389
off after like at 45 minutes or
an hour, sometimes he'll go for

1100
00:49:05,389 --> 00:49:08,148
like three hours or longer. And
then there's still like hundreds

1101
00:49:08,148 --> 00:49:12,079
of people and I'm just like,
wow, that's kudos to him there.

1102
00:49:14,429 --> 00:49:15,659
Bekah: I feel like you need
voice training for some or

1103
00:49:15,659 --> 00:49:16,889
something,

1104
00:49:16,918 --> 00:49:19,378
you know, like even talking,
even when I used to teach night

1105
00:49:19,378 --> 00:49:24,208
classes, like three hours of
having conversation and by the

1106
00:49:24,208 --> 00:49:27,266
end, My throat hurts, you know,
and like I am done, I, I did

1107
00:49:27,266 --> 00:49:30,324
know

1108
00:49:30,324 --> 00:49:33,048
a teacher who was taking voice
classes for that reason, because

1109
00:49:33,048 --> 00:49:35,772
they

1110
00:49:35,784 --> 00:49:38,213
were saying, it's, it's how
you're using your voice and you

1111
00:49:38,213 --> 00:49:39,503
have to do it in this different
way. And then you'll be fine.

1112
00:49:39,503 --> 00:49:40,793
And

1113
00:49:40,793 --> 00:49:47,949
exercise your muscle. Like, ah,
I know that's a lot. I mean, I

1114
00:49:47,949 --> 00:49:50,619
think it's the same thing for
writing too. It's it's a muscle

1115
00:49:50,619 --> 00:49:53,679
that you have to exercise. So I
imagine, I mean, you're writing

1116
00:49:53,679 --> 00:49:55,598
on a lot of new topics all the
time and learning things, but

1117
00:49:55,598 --> 00:49:57,517
has

1118
00:49:57,518 --> 00:49:59,498
the writing process gotten
easier?

1119
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:03,543
Jessica: Yeah. Yeah. I now have
more of like a game plan on how

1120
00:50:03,543 --> 00:50:05,058
I'm going to enter into an
article. And so I usually like

1121
00:50:05,058 --> 00:50:06,573
to

1122
00:50:06,574 --> 00:50:09,213
start off with just a little
introductory paragraph, knowing

1123
00:50:09,213 --> 00:50:11,914
I'm probably going to edit it
later on, but I just throw

1124
00:50:11,914 --> 00:50:15,003
something up and then I get into
the meat of the article and kind

1125
00:50:15,003 --> 00:50:19,023
of flesh it out. and then once I
clean up the actual main

1126
00:50:19,023 --> 00:50:21,994
part, then I can go through and
come up with a really good

1127
00:50:22,023 --> 00:50:25,384
introductory paragraph and a
conclusion there I try to focus

1128
00:50:25,384 --> 00:50:29,824
all my intention, you know, just
writing the main parts. And

1129
00:50:29,824 --> 00:50:33,139
sometimes I just do like a free
write. Throw words on the page

1130
00:50:33,139 --> 00:50:35,089
and of them make it some of
them, I cut out sections. I'm

1131
00:50:35,089 --> 00:50:37,039
like, I

1132
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:38,748
don't know what this was. I
mean, that just happened with

1133
00:50:38,748 --> 00:50:40,457
the

1134
00:50:40,458 --> 00:50:42,168
article a few weeks ago on how
to create tables and SQL. And

1135
00:50:42,168 --> 00:50:43,878
some

1136
00:50:43,878 --> 00:50:47,208
of those sections of like, why
this doesn't make any sense. I

1137
00:50:47,208 --> 00:50:48,948
don't know why this, I thought
this was relevant, but I was

1138
00:50:48,948 --> 00:50:50,688
just

1139
00:50:50,688 --> 00:50:53,028
throwing words on the page. I'm
like, oh, I should talk about

1140
00:50:53,028 --> 00:50:54,950
this. And then I read it back.
No, I shouldn't have talked

1141
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:56,872
about

1142
00:50:56,873 --> 00:50:59,784
that, but that's an easier? for
us to kind of cut things out

1143
00:50:59,784 --> 00:51:02,844
there and then just reshape it
into something acceptable that I

1144
00:51:02,844 --> 00:51:05,693
could send to the editor. she
doesn't have to look at it and

1145
00:51:05,693 --> 00:51:06,773
go, what is this?

1146
00:51:08,463 --> 00:51:09,663
Dan: There's one of the benefits
of the writing medium, right? Is

1147
00:51:09,663 --> 00:51:10,863
do you

1148
00:51:10,864 --> 00:51:14,733
have the, it easier to go back
and things out that don't make

1149
00:51:14,733 --> 00:51:14,974
sense,

1150
00:51:15,364 --> 00:51:16,324
Jessica: Exactly. Yeah.

1151
00:51:16,384 --> 00:51:18,439
Dan: as opposed to maybe a live
streamer, something things to

1152
00:51:18,439 --> 00:51:20,494
get

1153
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:20,914
out there?

1154
00:51:20,983 --> 00:51:23,143
Bekah: the expectation of live
streaming, so

1155
00:51:23,474 --> 00:51:23,914
Dan: no, for sure.

1156
00:51:24,974 --> 00:51:29,300
Bekah: acceptable thing. I can't
remember what to say. Oh,

1157
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:33,626
I

1158
00:51:33,626 --> 00:51:36,539
know what I was gonna say. Rough
drafts are so important.

1159
00:51:36,539 --> 00:51:39,452
I,

1160
00:51:39,452 --> 00:51:41,641
and I think that it's worth it
to point out that there's a

1161
00:51:41,641 --> 00:51:43,830
process

1162
00:51:43,862 --> 00:51:46,081
that you get better at that
process. And you have a rough

1163
00:51:46,081 --> 00:51:50,132
draft. No, nobody puts out a
perfect rough draft, a perfect

1164
00:51:50,132 --> 00:51:54,141
draft. The first time it is a
process and it does take time.

1165
00:51:55,097 --> 00:51:57,151
But You know, just listening to
you talk about tech, Jessica,

1166
00:51:57,151 --> 00:51:59,205
you

1167
00:51:59,237 --> 00:52:04,967
communicate it so wellthat it's
really, I feel like I learned a

1168
00:52:04,967 --> 00:52:08,757
lot just hearing you talk about
these things. And so you can

1169
00:52:08,757 --> 00:52:12,286
really appreciate that process
of learning and then, and how it

1170
00:52:12,286 --> 00:52:16,916
impacts the way that you talk
about things. And I imagine it,

1171
00:52:16,936 --> 00:52:18,991
that goes into interviewing and
stuff like that. Because if you

1172
00:52:18,991 --> 00:52:21,046
talk

1173
00:52:21,047 --> 00:52:22,797
with credibility, then people
are more likely to. see you

1174
00:52:22,797 --> 00:52:24,547
as a

1175
00:52:24,547 --> 00:52:25,536
credible person.

1176
00:52:26,356 --> 00:52:29,297
Jessica: Yeah, Yeah. And that's
the thing is that want to come

1177
00:52:29,297 --> 00:52:31,187
across as, how can I add value
to the company or organization

1178
00:52:31,187 --> 00:52:33,077
if

1179
00:52:33,077 --> 00:52:36,166
you come across as I just really
need a job? Well, the company's

1180
00:52:36,166 --> 00:52:37,546
not really hiring you because
you need a job. Like they're

1181
00:52:37,546 --> 00:52:38,926
hiring

1182
00:52:38,927 --> 00:52:40,727
you because they need people to
join their team and add value.

1183
00:52:40,727 --> 00:52:42,527
if

1184
00:52:42,527 --> 00:52:45,376
you come in and say, here's how
I can add value to you, then

1185
00:52:45,376 --> 00:52:48,347
they'll listen. And I think
that's just coming in with a

1186
00:52:48,347 --> 00:52:51,291
little bit of confidence. Will
go a long way there.

1187
00:52:53,206 --> 00:52:55,111
Bekah: Yeah, absolutely. So
we're at about time here, but

1188
00:52:55,111 --> 00:52:57,016
are there

1189
00:52:57,016 --> 00:53:02,297
any last tips that you have for
our listeners about getting,

1190
00:53:02,297 --> 00:53:04,007
started with writing?

1191
00:53:04,967 --> 00:53:09,737
Jessica: I think just the best
tip is just, get started. I

1192
00:53:09,737 --> 00:53:12,106
think a lot of people
procrastinate because they're

1193
00:53:12,106 --> 00:53:13,006
like, I don't know what to write
about. I don't know what to do.

1194
00:53:13,006 --> 00:53:13,906
I

1195
00:53:13,907 --> 00:53:17,416
don't know how to get started.
get started and just start

1196
00:53:17,416 --> 00:53:19,936
working from there. And you can
always ask for feedback within

1197
00:53:19,936 --> 00:53:21,406
your community and say, Hey, I'm
writing this article. I dunno

1198
00:53:21,406 --> 00:53:22,876
how

1199
00:53:22,876 --> 00:53:27,496
it really works it yet, or it
needs some help, but, don't

1200
00:53:27,496 --> 00:53:29,353
wait for the perfect momnet. To
get started writing? to just

1201
00:53:29,353 --> 00:53:31,210
start

1202
00:53:31,211 --> 00:53:32,666
writing, to start throwing some
words on the page, start

1203
00:53:32,666 --> 00:53:34,121
creating

1204
00:53:34,121 --> 00:53:37,961
an outline, then you can shape
it and edit it down from there.

1205
00:53:39,271 --> 00:53:40,246
