7
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:35,301
Here with me today is my co-host,
Dan

8
00:00:36,591 --> 00:00:37,942
Dan: Yo, what is.

9
00:00:39,561 --> 00:00:40,612
Bekah: the Sky.

10
00:00:41,121 --> 00:00:44,692
Dan: sky. I like it. Um, how's it
going,

11
00:00:46,101 --> 00:00:48,892
Bekah: it's fantastic. It's just
an amazing day here.

12
00:00:49,771 --> 00:00:54,171
Dan: Is it, it's really, really
cold here. so it was, uh, yeah,

13
00:00:54,201 --> 00:00:56,722
it's 17 degrees Fahrenheit, so,
uh,

14
00:00:56,962 --> 00:00:58,042
Bekah: 47 here.

15
00:00:58,582 --> 00:01:01,192
Dan: Really? No, you're lying to
me.

16
00:01:01,881 --> 00:01:02,752
Bekah: It's not, it's really

17
00:01:02,972 --> 00:01:04,042
Dan: Bekah's always lying to me.

18
00:01:05,001 --> 00:01:07,341
Bekah: I don't, I, I don't lie. I
don't

19
00:01:07,436 --> 00:01:11,287
Dan: No, no, that's, that's me.
I'm the Eagle Scout. You're the

20
00:01:11,456 --> 00:01:12,427
non-Eagle Scout

21
00:01:12,591 --> 00:01:15,022
Bekah: Oh, we all know about
Eagle Scouts and what kind of

22
00:01:15,022 --> 00:01:16,251
people they turn out to be.

23
00:01:17,647 --> 00:01:19,477
Dan: as soon as I said that, I
knew you were gonna bring that

24
00:01:19,477 --> 00:01:23,106
up. Bekah found. Actually, I
might have found it, I don't

25
00:01:23,106 --> 00:01:25,986
know. Remember I was saying about
how Eagle Scouts are all

26
00:01:25,986 --> 00:01:28,986
honorable and never lie, and we
found an article just

27
00:01:29,001 --> 00:01:31,341
Bekah: are a lot of murderers
that are Eagle Scouts,

28
00:01:31,701 --> 00:01:34,641
Dan: Yeah. Major crimes committed
by Eagle Scouts. And that was

29
00:01:34,671 --> 00:01:38,572
sad. And some people, sometimes
people fall off the, you know,

30
00:01:39,111 --> 00:01:40,012
Bekah: Eagle Scout Trail,

31
00:01:40,162 --> 00:01:44,721
Dan: the path. Yeah. The trail.
Exactly. Yes. So, you know, what

32
00:01:44,721 --> 00:01:45,201
are you gonna do?

33
00:01:46,221 --> 00:01:48,052
Bekah: We really derailed this
really quickly.

34
00:01:49,221 --> 00:01:52,671
Dan: Uh, yeah. It is kind of our,
our way, you know, uh, I think

35
00:01:52,671 --> 00:01:57,652
it's kind of apro. Um, anyway,
today we are talking with Kai.

36
00:01:58,072 --> 00:02:03,216
Kai is a tech content specialist
and mental health advocate. Um,

37
00:02:03,246 --> 00:02:06,246
they've been a member for a while
and very active in the community,

38
00:02:06,246 --> 00:02:08,276
and we had a really great
conversation.

39
00:02:09,426 --> 00:02:12,576
Bekah: Yeah. I really appreciate
their input on the learning

40
00:02:12,576 --> 00:02:17,706
experience about mental health,
about finding different paths

41
00:02:17,706 --> 00:02:21,757
into tech. I think that we all
come from different perspectives

42
00:02:21,757 --> 00:02:25,447
and to think about the different
ways, think about the different

43
00:02:25,447 --> 00:02:30,843
journeys that we take to get here
can create a hopeful space for

44
00:02:30,843 --> 00:02:32,674
people who are thinking about
coming into tech.

45
00:02:33,503 --> 00:02:34,514
Dan: Yeah, absolutely.

46
00:02:35,473 --> 00:02:37,993
Bekah: We start every episode of
the podcast, like we start every

47
00:02:37,993 --> 00:02:40,813
Virtual Coffee, we introduce
ourselves with our name, where

48
00:02:40,813 --> 00:02:44,834
we're from, what we do, and a
random check-in question. Our

49
00:02:44,838 --> 00:02:50,354
question today is, what is your
favorite story with a happy

50
00:02:50,413 --> 00:03:02,716
ending? We hope you enjoy this
episode. My name is Bekah. I'm a

51
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:10,186
technical community builder from
a small town in Ohio, and my

52
00:03:10,186 --> 00:03:13,126
favorite story with a happy
ending, I'm gonna go with the

53
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:16,816
Princess Bride just because
that's a fun book and a fun

54
00:03:16,816 --> 00:03:19,725
movie, and I enjoy it every
single time.

55
00:03:20,385 --> 00:03:23,836
Dan: You stole mine. I gotta stop
lady. You gotta stop going first

56
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:28,635
cuz you're always, it's the
worst. Um, the Princess Bride is

57
00:03:28,635 --> 00:03:33,225
amazing and it, that's, that's
like, anyway, it's a good choice,

58
00:03:33,256 --> 00:03:39,735
obviously. Uh, okay. I'm Dan. I
live in Cleveland. I do computer

59
00:03:39,741 --> 00:03:44,506
things. Uh, yeah. Favorite story
with that? You know, I don't

60
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:48,556
know. Um, I don't know, does Star
Wars have happened? It's hard.

61
00:03:48,556 --> 00:03:51,496
It's hard cuz now Star Wars has
all of this like extra stuff, you

62
00:03:51,496 --> 00:03:53,985
know what I mean? Uh, you know,
like, so if I just think of

63
00:03:53,985 --> 00:03:56,475
Return to The Jedi, it's mostly
happy, but you know, then all

64
00:03:56,475 --> 00:04:00,645
these things keep happening and
whatever and you know, uh, I feel

65
00:04:00,645 --> 00:04:02,985
like everybody nowadays has to
make everything all, you know,

66
00:04:02,985 --> 00:04:04,966
awful. Uh, I'm a

67
00:04:04,971 --> 00:04:08,325
Bekah: Not cartoons, though.
Every cartoon has a happy.

68
00:04:10,066 --> 00:04:12,256
Dan: you. You think so? Cuz I
don't, I don't know if that's.

69
00:04:13,175 --> 00:04:14,596
Bekah: Children's cartoons, not
like adult

70
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:20,730
Dan: Children's cartoons, Okay,
uh, yay. I'm gonna go with, um,

71
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:25,081
I'm gonna go with Elf cause I
like that movie

72
00:04:25,336 --> 00:04:25,576
Bekah: Love.

73
00:04:26,221 --> 00:04:29,880
Dan: it's happy. So that's gonna
be my answer. There's a lot of,

74
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,221
you know, there's a lot of
choices in that Christmas movie

75
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,401
realm, but, uh, elf is like one
of the best ones. So I'm going

76
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:36,821
with Elf. That's, that's my
answer.

77
00:04:37,353 --> 00:04:41,702
Kai: Hi, uh, my name is Kai. I am
a tech content specialist, and I

78
00:04:41,702 --> 00:04:43,983
completely panicked at this
question because if you ask a

79
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:46,833
neuro divergent person their
favorite anything, they will just

80
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:50,447
blank, and that's what happened.
But I've, but I've, but I found a

81
00:04:50,898 --> 00:04:51,017
solution,

82
00:04:51,788 --> 00:04:52,208
Bekah: Yay.

83
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,218
Kai: which is, there are two
movies that I go to when I feel

84
00:04:55,218 --> 00:04:57,557
sad, when I feel bad, when she
needs some comfort. I'm not

85
00:04:57,557 --> 00:05:01,757
usually a re watcher, but Moana
and Encanto both like do the

86
00:05:01,762 --> 00:05:05,208
trick and I guess technically
they have happy endings. So I'll

87
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:05,937
go with those two.

88
00:05:07,353 --> 00:05:09,437
Dan: those are, yeah, those are
very good ones.

89
00:05:10,187 --> 00:05:13,427
Bekah: Yeah, those are really
good choices. I recently was

90
00:05:13,427 --> 00:05:17,387
driving in my car with nobody
else and just listening to the

91
00:05:17,392 --> 00:05:19,608
Encanto soundtrack because it
makes me

92
00:05:19,608 --> 00:05:23,327
Kai: is, it is so good. There's,
there's no highest level volume

93
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:26,057
that is apt for that. It just
always needs to be louder.

94
00:05:26,747 --> 00:05:30,197
Bekah: Totally agree. I also like
to sing it as loud as I can too,

95
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:30,437
so

96
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:33,408
Kai: same. Same. I'm not good
with the Spanish parts, but, um,

97
00:05:33,468 --> 00:05:33,978
I try

98
00:05:34,728 --> 00:05:39,228
Bekah: Yep, same. Well, welcome.
We're really happy to have you

99
00:05:39,228 --> 00:05:44,331
here and the way that we always
like to get started is. With your

100
00:05:44,331 --> 00:05:49,040
journey into where you are now,
but I'm gonna ask you first to

101
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:54,440
think about your developer
journey and give us one word that

102
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,370
would describe it.

103
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,500
Kai: Overdue or long overdue, if
I can hyphenate.

104
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,370
Bekah: There you go. I like it. I
like it. So now tell us this long

105
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:07,310
overdue journey and how you got
to this point.

106
00:06:08,196 --> 00:06:12,425
Kai: I've, I've kind of been tech
adjacent for a very long time.

107
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:16,175
Originally, uh, study journalism.
I worked as a journalist. I

108
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:20,076
worked like daily broadsheet,
broadsheet newspaper kind of

109
00:06:20,076 --> 00:06:24,846
stuff. Um, so something entirely
different, but I've always had an

110
00:06:24,846 --> 00:06:30,146
affinity towards, uh, games,
tech, et cetera. Um, and then

111
00:06:30,716 --> 00:06:36,026
when I had enough of journalism
for various reasons, I decided,

112
00:06:36,026 --> 00:06:39,446
well, PR is kind of right next
door. I'll do that. And I ended

113
00:06:39,446 --> 00:06:44,906
up being the first, uh, PR hire
ever at a very small Austrian

114
00:06:44,935 --> 00:06:48,415
eSports company. It was an
eSports agency, and that's,

115
00:06:48,415 --> 00:06:53,911
that's kind of how. Like properly
slid into tech. I had previously

116
00:06:53,915 --> 00:06:56,230
obviously like had messed around
with a bit of website stuff like

117
00:06:56,230 --> 00:07:00,130
when I was younger, futz around
with, with WordPress stuff, but

118
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:03,670
nothing ever seriously, and even
then for it took me another.

119
00:07:04,266 --> 00:07:08,375
Well, I think 15 years to
properly get into it. I've spent

120
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:13,206
the past 10 years or so,
self-employed as a tech content

121
00:07:13,206 --> 00:07:16,415
specialist. Started as a
copywriter and then kind of just

122
00:07:16,415 --> 00:07:19,685
segued into consulting with
startups and the world tech

123
00:07:19,685 --> 00:07:25,706
startups. And my, my oldest
client, um, is a SaaS provider.

124
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:30,665
So yeah, I've been tech Jason for
a long time and I always like to

125
00:07:30,665 --> 00:07:35,511
say I, I speak developer. Or that
are that, you know, some of my

126
00:07:35,511 --> 00:07:40,161
best friends are developers, but
like they are They really are

127
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:45,350
We're always the people I clicked
with most. And um, yeah, about

128
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:48,920
six years ago, my partner side
stepped into tech. They did a

129
00:07:48,925 --> 00:07:53,451
bootcamp back when we lived in
Scotland. and still I wasn't, I

130
00:07:53,451 --> 00:07:56,120
wasn't coding myself. I was like,
no, it's too much like math. I'm

131
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,120
sure I can't do this. And
everyone's like, no, Kai, you'll

132
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,550
be, you'll be fine. I was like,
no, no, no, no. I don't have the

133
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:06,141
brain for this. And then finally,
finally, when I realized I wanted

134
00:08:06,141 --> 00:08:08,630
to go into Dev, I was like, oh,
maybe I should, maybe I should

135
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:14,420
get on that coding thing now.
And, uh, I did the, the Free Code

136
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:20,451
Camp, uh, boot camp for web dev,
which is HTML and CSS back in

137
00:08:20,451 --> 00:08:25,745
September. and I was hooked. I
was very surprised. No one else

138
00:08:25,745 --> 00:08:29,495
was surprised that I really took
to it Um, but I was also very

139
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:34,086
surprised that it was indeed not
very math-y. It was actually a

140
00:08:34,086 --> 00:08:35,255
lot like writing.

141
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,171
Bekah: Yes.

142
00:08:36,605 --> 00:08:39,005
Kai: If I think about it, like
I've been writing for such a long

143
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:43,176
time, I barely think about what I
do when I do it, I, I think about

144
00:08:43,176 --> 00:08:47,826
it when I try to help others,
right? I think about coding, and

145
00:08:47,826 --> 00:08:51,515
then I realize that the way I
think about coding is very much

146
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,385
what I tell other people when I
try to help them write better.

147
00:08:55,446 --> 00:08:58,385
Like you put down a structure and
then you fill in the blanks, and

148
00:08:58,385 --> 00:09:00,755
then you fill in the details and
you think of your story first,

149
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,836
and you put that down and then
the rest comes by itself. And

150
00:09:05,556 --> 00:09:12,785
yeah, whether you, you go. Text
to edit and proofread and

151
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:15,216
restructure. Sometimes you have
to restructure. That's totally

152
00:09:15,216 --> 00:09:19,206
normal when blogging, for
example, or whether you go and

153
00:09:19,206 --> 00:09:24,155
you, you go through your code and
make it better. Like it's, it's

154
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,666
the same thing at the end of the
day. So yeah, that's, that's how

155
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:32,000
I ended up where I'm now, which
is. I can do HTML and css, which

156
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,591
is not a lot, but I feel like I'm
getting better at it, and the

157
00:09:37,071 --> 00:09:39,441
probably next step will be
Python, but we'll see.

158
00:09:40,711 --> 00:09:43,160
Bekah: I really love those
parallels between writing

159
00:09:44,061 --> 00:09:47,841
technical content and coding
because my background is in

160
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:51,471
English. I taught college English
for 10 years and I found that

161
00:09:51,471 --> 00:09:55,130
same thing, and for me it kind of
like took a while to make that

162
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:59,321
parallel because I think I. Just
wanted to get out of that space

163
00:09:59,321 --> 00:10:05,046
for so long. Like I was, I was
done. Being a teacher, I was done

164
00:10:05,046 --> 00:10:08,676
with that English teacher side of
myself. And then when I finally

165
00:10:08,676 --> 00:10:12,395
like let go of that anger I was
like, oh, okay, these are kind of

166
00:10:12,395 --> 00:10:17,166
similar and I understand what's
happening here in this context.

167
00:10:17,405 --> 00:10:20,645
And then actually like once I
made that connection, it became a

168
00:10:20,645 --> 00:10:23,706
little bit easier because for
those reasons that you said, like

169
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:26,316
you're breaking it down, you're
looking at the patterns and the

170
00:10:26,316 --> 00:10:29,765
structure, and you're able to see
it from a different perspective.

171
00:10:30,331 --> 00:10:34,380
Kai: Yeah, and it's also, I mean,
you say you tried to get away

172
00:10:34,385 --> 00:10:39,931
from it from, for me it's kind
of, I really love like blending

173
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:42,870
those two, which is why Dev
appeals to me so much because

174
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:48,615
it's a way to. Bring everything
I've already sort of collected

175
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:52,125
over the years and skills and
weird skills and weird knowledge

176
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:55,875
to the table, but also this new
thing for me, which is coding,

177
00:10:55,875 --> 00:11:00,015
and it's kind of awesome how that
can all kind of meld together.

178
00:11:00,437 --> 00:11:06,378
Dan: Yeah, I think, I think
that's really great. Uh, I I

179
00:11:06,378 --> 00:11:08,327
don't know, you, you were at the
beginning of your story, you were

180
00:11:08,327 --> 00:11:11,057
talking about how you sort of
avoided, you know, avoided all

181
00:11:11,057 --> 00:11:12,888
the coding stuff cuz um,

182
00:11:14,113 --> 00:11:17,143
Kai: I didn't avoid it. I just
never like properly learned it

183
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:18,493
and I thought I wouldn't be good
at it,

184
00:11:18,898 --> 00:11:22,378
Dan: Right. Avoided, avoided,
like actually diving in. Right.

185
00:11:22,378 --> 00:11:27,268
And that's, I, I feel like
that's, uh, a, that cer certainly

186
00:11:27,268 --> 00:11:31,408
in my personal experience, uh,
and I think that this is a common

187
00:11:31,408 --> 00:11:34,977
occurrence with her, divergent
people. Is that, that sort of

188
00:11:34,977 --> 00:11:38,592
thing where, where like, uh,
Something is like an unknown and

189
00:11:38,592 --> 00:11:41,413
it, and it, and your brain does
this thing where it's just like,

190
00:11:41,413 --> 00:11:44,263
no way. I can't, like I'm either
I can't do it or I don't wanna do

191
00:11:44,263 --> 00:11:47,263
it or, or whatever. You know,
like it, it becomes this like, I

192
00:11:47,263 --> 00:11:49,363
don't know, this weird block
thing. Right. You know that

193
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:49,947
Kai: Do not.

194
00:11:51,852 --> 00:11:55,033
Dan: Right, right. Yeah. Yeah.
And I've had that experience so

195
00:11:55,038 --> 00:11:59,863
many times, you know, and, and
whether it's like some piece of

196
00:11:59,863 --> 00:12:04,692
technology or some like thing, I
avoided react for a, a real long

197
00:12:04,692 --> 00:12:08,248
time cuz it was just, I don't
know. I just, like, I looked at,

198
00:12:08,253 --> 00:12:11,518
I glanced at it, read a blog
post, didn't really immediately

199
00:12:11,518 --> 00:12:15,628
understand it completely. And so
I'm like, Nope, I just, you know,

200
00:12:15,628 --> 00:12:18,057
I don't know. And then once you
dig into it, you find that you

201
00:12:18,057 --> 00:12:21,268
actually like it. I, I, I feel
like that that resonated with me

202
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:23,607
and I, and I, and I also feel
like, might resonate with other

203
00:12:23,607 --> 00:12:25,677
people too. I, I think it's kind,
kind of common thing.

204
00:12:26,503 --> 00:12:29,773
Kai: I am really glad you said
that because I recently started

205
00:12:30,072 --> 00:12:32,322
cuz I thought like JavaScript
would be a good next step and I

206
00:12:32,322 --> 00:12:36,013
started looking at it and I had
to fight the urge to, to quit.

207
00:12:36,702 --> 00:12:40,033
Because the resources I had tried
didn't work and I just kept

208
00:12:40,033 --> 00:12:43,153
looking at different resources
until I found one that didn't

209
00:12:43,153 --> 00:12:46,812
make me want to run away. But
like that urge is there and I'm

210
00:12:46,817 --> 00:12:48,883
kind of relieved that I'm not
alone with this,

211
00:12:49,408 --> 00:12:51,807
Dan: yeah, yeah, yeah. Big time.

212
00:12:52,817 --> 00:12:55,837
Bekah: For sure when I was
learning, I was going through

213
00:12:55,837 --> 00:13:00,278
Free Code Camp initially, and I
got to the JavaScript portion and

214
00:13:00,307 --> 00:13:03,337
that was like a brick wall. I
could not make it through, and I

215
00:13:03,337 --> 00:13:07,057
thought, you know what, maybe,
maybe this is not for me, until I

216
00:13:07,057 --> 00:13:11,227
found a different curriculum that
approached it in a different way

217
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:15,727
and then suddenly it was like,
okay, I can handle this. It's, it

218
00:13:15,727 --> 00:13:21,472
wasn't ever easy, but it made
more sense to me and it was. An

219
00:13:21,477 --> 00:13:26,913
introduction that my brain could
kind of understand and ease into.

220
00:13:27,832 --> 00:13:31,432
Kai: that, that's exactly like, I
also tried it with Free Code Camp

221
00:13:31,432 --> 00:13:33,863
cuz I was like, okay, I did the
bootcamp there. I know what I

222
00:13:33,863 --> 00:13:37,732
dislike about Free Code Camp.
Like some of their, some of the

223
00:13:37,738 --> 00:13:41,993
structure they force upon you
within an h l file just does not

224
00:13:41,993 --> 00:13:45,503
work for me. But like I know
that, and I, I am aware of that.

225
00:13:45,503 --> 00:13:47,602
I can deal with that and I'll
just do the JavaScript thing

226
00:13:47,602 --> 00:13:52,717
there and I opened it and. What
the hell? I, I just like you

227
00:13:52,717 --> 00:13:55,988
said, hit the brick wall and I
tried exorcism and that was like

228
00:13:55,988 --> 00:14:00,998
less explainy, but also kind of
assumed that I would know more

229
00:14:01,028 --> 00:14:05,197
than I did, which was zero. Um,
and then I keep, I kept like

230
00:14:05,197 --> 00:14:09,427
looking around for different
resources and finally it was Code

231
00:14:09,427 --> 00:14:13,238
Academy that actually worked the
best for me. I don't know what

232
00:14:13,238 --> 00:14:16,597
you used, but now I wanna.
Because maybe I should try that

233
00:14:16,597 --> 00:14:16,878
as well.

234
00:14:18,383 --> 00:14:21,322
Bekah: I ended up going into a
bootcamp, so I went to a Flatiron

235
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:25,403
School bootcamp and they had some
pre-work that you could do, and

236
00:14:25,403 --> 00:14:28,552
once I did the pre-work, it
suddenly, like all of these

237
00:14:28,552 --> 00:14:31,673
things started to click into
place for me and that's when I

238
00:14:31,673 --> 00:14:35,393
kind of thought like, this is.
This makes sense. And luckily I

239
00:14:35,393 --> 00:14:38,452
was able to get a scholarship to
go there. Otherwise, you know,

240
00:14:38,452 --> 00:14:42,533
that wouldn't have worked out.
But exploring all of the

241
00:14:42,533 --> 00:14:46,283
different resources that are out
there, I think is really

242
00:14:46,288 --> 00:14:50,513
important to that learning
journey because we all learn in

243
00:14:50,513 --> 00:14:50,972
different ways.

244
00:14:51,923 --> 00:14:54,773
Kai: Yeah. And also like
different topic might require you

245
00:14:54,773 --> 00:14:58,102
to use a different, um, resource
is what I've learned through

246
00:14:58,102 --> 00:15:02,182
this. Like HTML CSS that worked
for me with Free Code Camp. Not

247
00:15:02,187 --> 00:15:06,893
ideal, but it worked. Js
currently not. So yeah, I think

248
00:15:06,893 --> 00:15:09,653
it's a good idea to keep, keep an
eye out for all these like

249
00:15:09,653 --> 00:15:13,613
different resources. Even if you
found one that works for you with

250
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:15,952
one thing, maybe for another
language, you need another one,

251
00:15:15,952 --> 00:15:16,403
you know?

252
00:15:17,773 --> 00:15:20,123
Dan: And I imagine some of that
is probably, there's different

253
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:24,038
authors that. you know, those
guides. I mean, I'd be, I guess

254
00:15:24,043 --> 00:15:26,918
you know that, so that could be
part of it. And, and yeah,

255
00:15:26,918 --> 00:15:28,988
everybody learns completely
differently. I always like

256
00:15:28,988 --> 00:15:31,418
hearing how, how people like
prefer to learn, right? Because

257
00:15:31,418 --> 00:15:31,927
it's always,

258
00:15:32,173 --> 00:15:32,663
Kai: Yeah.

259
00:15:33,097 --> 00:15:36,298
Dan: my learning style is
ridiculous and it's just it's,

260
00:15:36,503 --> 00:15:39,722
Kai: bet it is. I bet it is not
ridiculous. What is your learning

261
00:15:39,722 --> 00:15:40,123
style?

262
00:15:40,508 --> 00:15:42,788
Dan: oh, I don't know. Like, I,
that's the problem is I can't

263
00:15:42,788 --> 00:15:45,937
really describe it. I, I, I can't
do videos. I can't have people

264
00:15:45,937 --> 00:15:51,982
talking at me. I can't like, uh,
long form. Reading, you know, is

265
00:15:52,013 --> 00:15:56,003
honestly not even ideal for me.
It, it's, it's more just like I

266
00:15:56,003 --> 00:15:58,793
need to just like start using my
hands immediately and then

267
00:15:59,633 --> 00:16:00,113
Kai: I, I don't

268
00:16:00,143 --> 00:16:02,753
Dan: into a s i, I know, I, I, I
was,

269
00:16:02,812 --> 00:16:06,503
Kai: ridiculous, then I'm also
ridiculous because that's exactly

270
00:16:06,503 --> 00:16:06,893
how I

271
00:16:07,163 --> 00:16:09,653
Dan: yeah, yeah. I know. It's,
it's like, it's, it's not

272
00:16:09,653 --> 00:16:12,832
ridiculous. It's just hard to
describe. And also like, like I

273
00:16:12,832 --> 00:16:16,253
can't be like, Hey, do this. You
know, it's not, um, other than

274
00:16:16,253 --> 00:16:18,653
saying, get to building as soon
as you can, like, that works for

275
00:16:18,653 --> 00:16:22,238
me, you know? But after that it's
just like, there's no, there's no

276
00:16:22,238 --> 00:16:25,238
specific, you know, resource or
style or whatever that's ever

277
00:16:25,477 --> 00:16:28,477
really worked for me other than
like trying to push through by

278
00:16:28,482 --> 00:16:32,888
myself. And, um, and then like I
run into a specific problem and

279
00:16:32,893 --> 00:16:35,048
then I'm like, okay, let's go
look to see how to solve like

280
00:16:35,048 --> 00:16:38,707
this one thing, you know? And I
don't know, it, it, it has worked

281
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:42,518
for me. It's, it never feels like
the most efficient way. Um, and

282
00:16:42,518 --> 00:16:47,467
it's, it's hard to sort of
translate that into. Um, advice

283
00:16:47,467 --> 00:16:50,238
for people often, for me anyway,
it's hard for me to translate

284
00:16:50,238 --> 00:16:53,798
that into advice, uh, but like,
or at least actionable advice,

285
00:16:54,788 --> 00:16:57,878
other than, um, other than
getting your hands dirty, uh, for

286
00:16:57,878 --> 00:17:01,837
me, you know, it works and, but
like I said, everybody works, uh,

287
00:17:01,868 --> 00:17:04,778
learns differently and some
people like to have a lot more,

288
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:09,307
you know, uh, a lot more like, I
don't know, a plan in their head

289
00:17:09,307 --> 00:17:12,038
before they start doing that or
whatever. And I, I get that too.

290
00:17:12,038 --> 00:17:12,367
So

291
00:17:12,607 --> 00:17:15,157
Kai: I think, I think we're very
similar. Um, yeah, I think it's

292
00:17:15,157 --> 00:17:18,488
called kinesthetic learning. Like
if you learned through doing, if

293
00:17:18,488 --> 00:17:20,998
I'm not doing it, I'm not gonna
remember it. people are always

294
00:17:21,002 --> 00:17:23,188
super helpful with like, oh,
that's this great book I read.

295
00:17:23,188 --> 00:17:26,548
It's like, Nope. If it's not
nonfic, like it's not fiction,

296
00:17:26,548 --> 00:17:29,968
I'm not gonna read it and I doubt
it's gonna be a fiction. Of

297
00:17:29,968 --> 00:17:33,087
course. Um, and people, I was
like, oh, but like udemi and

298
00:17:33,087 --> 00:17:35,998
videos and, and I'm like, I do
not learn from it. I mean, I have

299
00:17:35,998 --> 00:17:38,218
this one udemi course that I'm
now working through, which is

300
00:17:38,222 --> 00:17:42,837
basically just to fill some CSS
holes maybe, or whatever. I'm

301
00:17:42,837 --> 00:17:46,048
listening to it at like the top
speed. It's, I think two times

302
00:17:46,053 --> 00:17:49,897
as. Twice as the top speed and
I'm just zooming through it. And

303
00:17:49,897 --> 00:17:53,978
that's, that's the only way I
can, my, my ADHD brain can handle

304
00:17:53,978 --> 00:17:58,327
this because Yeah. No, I feel, I
feel the same way. I'm, you

305
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:00,877
gotta, you gotta tell me, okay,
this is a little bit you can do

306
00:18:00,877 --> 00:18:03,337
and then let me do it and then
I'll figure it out from there.

307
00:18:03,337 --> 00:18:05,627
But, um, that's how I learn.

308
00:18:06,057 --> 00:18:09,238
Bekah: I really love, uh,
learning through examples, but

309
00:18:09,238 --> 00:18:11,758
like examples that you can
manipulate, right? Like if

310
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:17,577
there's a sandbox in there, Expo
has, um, Expo Snacks for a bunch

311
00:18:17,577 --> 00:18:22,528
of things and that has been
really helpful to me. Anytime I'm

312
00:18:22,528 --> 00:18:26,288
trying to use Expo, because I can
see what they're doing, I can

313
00:18:26,292 --> 00:18:32,022
play around with it, I can make
it my own. Okay. This is, this is

314
00:18:32,022 --> 00:18:35,742
how this works. It's already
there constructed for me, but it

315
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:38,682
gives me, you know, a little bit
of leadway to explore it.

316
00:18:39,145 --> 00:18:42,836
Kai: Yeah. I also, I don't know
how you all feel about, um,

317
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,566
things that feel pointless, but
if, if you give me an exercise

318
00:18:45,566 --> 00:18:48,715
and I don't see the point of it,
like of course with Free Code

319
00:18:48,715 --> 00:18:51,415
Camp, you have these like
projects that you have to do and

320
00:18:51,415 --> 00:18:54,685
it's like create a product page.
I'm like, I don't wanna create a

321
00:18:54,685 --> 00:18:58,256
product page for some. In the
end, what I did to get myself

322
00:18:58,256 --> 00:19:02,111
through it, I created a product
page. and the product was, you

323
00:19:02,111 --> 00:19:07,361
can, you can send my dogs pets,
you can pet my dogs from afar

324
00:19:07,361 --> 00:19:11,681
through a form. And that's how I
got myself through it. But like I

325
00:19:11,681 --> 00:19:14,830
wasn't, I was never gonna write
like, fake documentation just

326
00:19:14,836 --> 00:19:18,520
through the project. I just did
the basic stuff, uh, to pass the,

327
00:19:19,181 --> 00:19:23,020
you know, the test and that was
it. I'm not proud of it, but I

328
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,990
figure I'll need that stuff at
some point when I do an actual

329
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:29,125
project. I'm just not good at
doing things senseless. Is my

330
00:19:29,365 --> 00:19:29,885
main issue.

331
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:33,820
Bekah: I, I find like even
writing blog posts, like dev

332
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:37,990
related blog posts where I need
to come up with a code sample, I

333
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:40,961
have a really hard time like not
trying to come up with some kind

334
00:19:40,961 --> 00:19:44,020
of meaningful project. And I know
that I'll spend like way too much

335
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:47,201
time. Like this is, this is not
what it's about. Like the point

336
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:51,401
of this blog post is not to
showcase a meaningful project,

337
00:19:51,431 --> 00:19:55,901
it's to showcase how to utilize
this code. And so then I, I was

338
00:19:55,901 --> 00:19:59,836
working on this project a couple
months back and. it, it got

339
00:19:59,836 --> 00:20:03,405
really in depth, right? And like
there were, there were so many

340
00:20:03,405 --> 00:20:05,865
different features going on, and
I'm like, this is, this is all

341
00:20:05,865 --> 00:20:08,806
wrong. This is not how you're
supposed to do this. And so then

342
00:20:08,806 --> 00:20:13,996
I just like restarted it. I I
made one component and that was

343
00:20:13,996 --> 00:20:17,415
it. But it was like this whole
big thing in my mind because it

344
00:20:17,445 --> 00:20:21,855
didn't make sense without like
having this important idea that

345
00:20:21,855 --> 00:20:26,026
it was capturing but the wrong,
the wrong important idea.

346
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:29,141
Kai: I, I think that's a
storyteller brain though, as

347
00:20:29,141 --> 00:20:32,171
well. Like you need the story
like, but what's the story? You

348
00:20:32,175 --> 00:20:36,070
know, but what, what is the story
And if I'm, yeah, at least doing

349
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:40,300
something fun or funny helps,
there's this like tribute page in

350
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:44,651
the code camp thing that you have
to do. And I can think of anyone

351
00:20:44,651 --> 00:20:46,800
real. So I made a tribute page to
Han Solo.

352
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,250
Dan: Oh,

353
00:20:48,461 --> 00:20:51,851
Kai: at least that used me and I
looked up random Star Wars facts,

354
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:55,330
you know? So, yeah, I don't know
that, that that's how we get

355
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:58,030
through it. I think we, we build
our own stories to make the

356
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:03,070
learning bearable. Like I love
learning new things, but it's

357
00:21:03,076 --> 00:21:03,881
gotta be my way.

358
00:21:06,161 --> 00:21:09,941
Bekah: Well, and that also helps
you commit those things to memory

359
00:21:09,941 --> 00:21:13,901
too, right? Like when you are,
whether you're creating a story

360
00:21:13,901 --> 00:21:17,020
or hearing a story, you're more
likely to remember that thing.

361
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:20,980
And so I think that if you are
learning and you are making it

362
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,800
something fun for you or
meaningful, or telling a story

363
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,290
through the project that you're
creating, then you're gonna be

364
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:30,300
more likely to understand that.
and to remember how to do it the

365
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:34,441
next time, and I don't, well, I
gave a talk on that yesterday, so

366
00:21:34,441 --> 00:21:35,911
I feel like that's undervalued.

367
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:41,996
Kai: I totally agree with you. I,
I, I guess when I, when I, you

368
00:21:41,996 --> 00:21:45,086
know, I started out as a
journalist, copywriter, and then.

369
00:21:46,421 --> 00:21:49,810
Added more things sort of to my
portfolio skills and at some

370
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:52,300
point I just, I just called
myself a storyteller, which

371
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:55,421
sounds super pretentious and
obnoxious, but that was kind of

372
00:21:55,421 --> 00:21:59,050
the best way to sum it up because
whether I was writing or whether

373
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:02,020
I was helping startups figure out
their target group and had to

374
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,540
structure their website and had
to write the copy and had to,

375
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:07,721
what kind of images to use it, it
was all about telling a story and

376
00:22:07,721 --> 00:22:10,931
I think everything is about
telling a story in the end.

377
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:14,411
Everything that's good is about
telling a story.

378
00:22:14,726 --> 00:22:18,415
Bekah: 100% right. Smash that
like button. Whatever you do when

379
00:22:18,816 --> 00:22:21,895
somebody says something that you
100% agree with.

380
00:22:22,151 --> 00:22:22,641
Kai: Yeah.

381
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:27,836
Bekah: Yeah. You know, in finding
that there, there's such a

382
00:22:27,836 --> 00:22:31,615
balance that comes with that,
right? Like, um, you ever look up

383
00:22:31,615 --> 00:22:35,096
a recipe and they like wanna tell
you the whole story of like their

384
00:22:35,096 --> 00:22:39,145
grandma's birth and like how they
grandma seasoned their cast iron

385
00:22:39,151 --> 00:22:40,915
pan and then like three hours

386
00:22:41,056 --> 00:22:43,415
Kai: the one case where I don't
want the story.

387
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:47,141
Bekah: Right at least now a lot
of them have like skipped a

388
00:22:47,141 --> 00:22:51,161
recipe. Yes, please. But it's
like, it's finding that balance,

389
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:55,661
I think of weaving that story and
then like also giving the

390
00:22:55,661 --> 00:22:59,891
information that people need.
Because if it's really heavy on

391
00:22:59,895 --> 00:23:04,181
the storytelling or it's not
contextual, I think that you can

392
00:23:04,181 --> 00:23:10,016
tell stories through how you
write your code. Um, But you, you

393
00:23:10,016 --> 00:23:15,086
have to find that balance in
order to, um, you know, support

394
00:23:15,086 --> 00:23:17,516
what you're doing and your
audience.

395
00:23:18,073 --> 00:23:21,073
Kai: Yeah, no, I've, I've.
Definitely have that issue with,

396
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:25,123
with blog posts on, like recipes
and stuff. Because very often the

397
00:23:25,123 --> 00:23:28,752
story is also not very well told
and not very, and you can tell

398
00:23:28,752 --> 00:23:32,022
they wanna get to the recipe, but
I guess for SEO or whatever

399
00:23:32,022 --> 00:23:34,903
purposes, they're putting all
this stuff before and you keep

400
00:23:34,903 --> 00:23:37,542
thinking, oh sure, our next
paragraph's gonna be the no,

401
00:23:37,542 --> 00:23:41,143
still not the recipe. But surely
now the story is, no, it's still

402
00:23:41,143 --> 00:23:45,057
not over. And I think it also
says something about how they,

403
00:23:45,147 --> 00:23:49,077
like a lot of people write
stories where with a good story

404
00:23:49,077 --> 00:23:51,178
you feel when it's, when it's
getting to an end. Like when you

405
00:23:51,178 --> 00:23:55,647
feel like if you've got a 30
minute TV episode and you can

406
00:23:55,647 --> 00:23:58,018
feel when it's end, when it's
about to end. Even if you don't

407
00:23:58,022 --> 00:24:01,468
look at the time because the
story is told in a certain way

408
00:24:01,468 --> 00:24:04,438
and the plot points are
positioned in a certain way,

409
00:24:05,137 --> 00:24:07,377
positioned in a certain way that
you, you can just tell, you can

410
00:24:07,377 --> 00:24:12,627
feel it. And I think. that's also
part of good storytelling. Um,

411
00:24:13,048 --> 00:24:17,367
you need to know when to end,
even though I dunno when to end

412
00:24:17,367 --> 00:24:18,478
my sentences clearly.

413
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:23,488
Bekah: I, I have the same
problem. I will frequently end

414
00:24:23,488 --> 00:24:27,417
sentences with the word, so it's
like a filler word for me. Like

415
00:24:27,417 --> 00:24:34,347
say a whole sentence and I'll be
like, so, so I'm to do it.

416
00:24:35,367 --> 00:24:38,157
Kai: last year. Last year I gave
my first talk in a very long

417
00:24:38,157 --> 00:24:43,198
time, and when I listened back at
the recording, I realized that in

418
00:24:43,198 --> 00:24:47,847
the, because my, my teachers
hammered it into us, not say, um,

419
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:52,768
or ah, you know, as fill word. So
instead of doing that, apparently

420
00:24:52,768 --> 00:25:00,357
now, I say now, now, All the
time. And now I'm trying to not

421
00:25:00,363 --> 00:25:04,018
do that and I guess I'll just
pick up the next filler word on

422
00:25:04,018 --> 00:25:07,887
the go. One day I'll, so as well
at the end of a sentence, you

423
00:25:07,887 --> 00:25:08,097
just

424
00:25:08,143 --> 00:25:11,113
Bekah: I am sorry. I'm sorry if I
pass that on to you. the world

425
00:25:11,113 --> 00:25:12,042
doesn't need more of that.

426
00:25:12,567 --> 00:25:14,038
Kai: different, you know, every
time I

427
00:25:14,925 --> 00:25:16,996
Bekah: was just gonna start a
sentence with, so, and now I am

428
00:25:16,996 --> 00:25:18,645
like hyperaware of all of it.

429
00:25:20,786 --> 00:25:21,976
Kai: We can fix it in post.

430
00:25:25,455 --> 00:25:27,615
Bekah: can't do it. So

431
00:25:28,111 --> 00:25:31,141
Dan: try, try using triz now.
Maybe that'll work.

432
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:37,546
Bekah: Now you're doing all of
this content creation. Um, You

433
00:25:37,546 --> 00:25:40,605
have all of this experience.
Right. And I wanna back up for a

434
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:43,935
second and talk a little bit
about this idea that you speak

435
00:25:44,056 --> 00:25:47,115
tech. I think that's what you
said, and I really like to think

436
00:25:47,115 --> 00:25:49,665
about it in that way because I
think that there are also people

437
00:25:49,665 --> 00:25:53,776
in tech that don't speak tech,
right? Communication is can be a

438
00:25:53,776 --> 00:25:56,955
problem. Being able to
communicate your ideas and you're

439
00:25:56,955 --> 00:26:01,105
doing it in a lot of different,
Right, like you gave a talk last

440
00:26:01,105 --> 00:26:05,125
week. You are writing blog posts,
you're definitely doing dev

441
00:26:05,576 --> 00:26:11,726
things. And so how do you
approach creating that content?

442
00:26:11,726 --> 00:26:16,586
And, and maybe also like, what do
you like the most? What are, what

443
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:18,955
is most enjoyable content
creation for you?

444
00:26:19,428 --> 00:26:23,538
Kai: So with blogging, I blogging
has kind of lost its spark

445
00:26:23,542 --> 00:26:26,508
because I blogged for the same
company for the past eight and a

446
00:26:26,508 --> 00:26:28,877
half years, and at some point I
didn't get around to blogging for

447
00:26:28,877 --> 00:26:35,238
myself anymore. And that kind of
just, just, Went away. Like I was

448
00:26:35,268 --> 00:26:38,147
like, you know, when you, when
you some whatever you do for

449
00:26:38,147 --> 00:26:41,597
work, it's really hard to do that
for fun as well. Um, I feel like

450
00:26:41,597 --> 00:26:44,958
developers are less afflicted by
this, but you know, chefs, they

451
00:26:44,988 --> 00:26:46,998
cook all day in the kitchen. They
come home, they're not interested

452
00:26:46,998 --> 00:26:49,188
in doing that at home. They eat
peanut butter and jelly

453
00:26:49,188 --> 00:26:54,107
sandwiches. Um, So that's, that's
how I feel a bit about blogging.

454
00:26:54,107 --> 00:26:56,748
But I, but I also miss it. So I
actually started because

455
00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:58,817
everyone, I was like, you gotta
learn in public, you gotta learn

456
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:01,248
in public. And I was like, yes, I
know, but I'm so chaotic when I

457
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:04,698
try to figure stuff out that I
don't wanna do this entirely in

458
00:27:04,698 --> 00:27:07,428
public. But I just, like,
literally an hour ago, started

459
00:27:07,432 --> 00:27:10,938
writing a blog post about why I'm
currently hard coding my website

460
00:27:10,938 --> 00:27:13,637
and that I don't think I am, I
have lost all my marbles for

461
00:27:13,637 --> 00:27:20,928
doing this. And I really. Like
my, my main client has always let

462
00:27:20,928 --> 00:27:24,617
me bring my own voice to my post
and everything, so that's great.

463
00:27:24,617 --> 00:27:28,157
But I really enjoyed writing for
myself again, which I think

464
00:27:28,157 --> 00:27:32,627
partly is because I've now been,
so I've been taking a break in

465
00:27:32,633 --> 00:27:36,018
January of from work. While I
transitioned from self-employment

466
00:27:36,018 --> 00:27:40,248
to employment, and I think just
like these were two, three weeks

467
00:27:40,248 --> 00:27:43,248
of not blogging for work have
made it much more enjoyable for

468
00:27:43,248 --> 00:27:47,837
me, and I feel like I'm finding
my way back. That said, I also

469
00:27:47,837 --> 00:27:50,718
went to film school for a year,
so I've, I've done that kind of

470
00:27:50,807 --> 00:27:57,692
kind of storytelling as well. Um,
I enjoy live streaming because

471
00:27:57,692 --> 00:28:02,853
it's very ad hoc. It, my d h d
brain likes it not having to

472
00:28:02,853 --> 00:28:05,972
prepare too much and just going
with the flow and it's exciting.

473
00:28:06,843 --> 00:28:10,173
Um, same with podcasts and stuff
like that. I was on a podcast

474
00:28:10,742 --> 00:28:15,603
last week, um, which is called
Coming Out Pod, about my, um,

475
00:28:16,053 --> 00:28:21,127
coming out journey basically. Um,
Really enjoy that. But what I

476
00:28:21,127 --> 00:28:27,188
think what I like most about
giving talks is that I can sit

477
00:28:27,188 --> 00:28:32,978
down and I can take my time and
write my story and refine it and

478
00:28:32,978 --> 00:28:39,377
like really, really. Make it not
perfect, but as perfect as it's

479
00:28:39,377 --> 00:28:42,498
gonna get. And sometimes that's
like the evening before the talk

480
00:28:42,498 --> 00:28:44,837
where you make the last take. I'm
pretty sure you know that. I

481
00:28:44,837 --> 00:28:45,887
think you said something like
that,

482
00:28:46,353 --> 00:28:47,252
Bekah: Yep. That was me,

483
00:28:47,837 --> 00:28:51,567
Kai: when you just, you just feel
like something in the. In the way

484
00:28:51,567 --> 00:28:55,077
you build your talk. Like it's
okay, but something isn't quite

485
00:28:55,077 --> 00:28:57,928
right. And for weeks, like, like
with the last one for weeks, I

486
00:28:57,928 --> 00:29:00,387
couldn't figure it out. I knew
something was wrong with my

487
00:29:00,387 --> 00:29:04,268
intro, but I couldn't figure it
out. And then like, I think the

488
00:29:04,272 --> 00:29:08,337
day before my talk, I was like,
now I've got it. And I changed it

489
00:29:08,343 --> 00:29:12,327
and it flowed. And this, this
feeling is really amazing. And

490
00:29:12,327 --> 00:29:15,988
especially when you, when you're
giving talks live and not

491
00:29:15,988 --> 00:29:20,387
recorded, even if it's like just
online. Um, I enjoy that bit of

492
00:29:20,387 --> 00:29:23,837
the adrenaline and everything. So
yeah, I'm currently really

493
00:29:23,837 --> 00:29:27,557
enjoying writing talks, which is
good because I thought I was

494
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:30,228
giving my next one in two months,
but I found out yesterday. It's

495
00:29:30,228 --> 00:29:33,647
really in one month and it's a
new talk that I haven't written

496
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:37,548
yet, so, so that, that's great.
And, uh, hilariously it's a talk

497
00:29:37,548 --> 00:29:41,928
about being organized with ADHD.
So now I've got a really good

498
00:29:41,928 --> 00:29:43,998
intro into, good intro into that
talk

499
00:29:44,807 --> 00:29:45,897
Bekah: That is, that is.

500
00:29:47,432 --> 00:29:50,762
Kai: So, yeah. Um, to get back to
your question, I, I enjoy all

501
00:29:50,762 --> 00:29:54,380
kinds of different content. I
enjoy the ad hoc style where you

502
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:57,380
just actually talk to people. And
I love interviewing people. I

503
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:00,410
love talking to people and then
figuring out how to tell their

504
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:03,019
story as well. I've done a lot of
showcase interviews and stuff

505
00:30:03,019 --> 00:30:07,910
like that. Um, but I also love
being able to just like, sit down

506
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:12,694
and create my own story and find
a way to tell that because a. The

507
00:30:12,694 --> 00:30:16,625
talks like the talks I give are
personal, um, mental health

508
00:30:16,625 --> 00:30:22,115
related, ADHD related. It's kind
of nice to find a way to put that

509
00:30:22,115 --> 00:30:23,105
story into words.

510
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:24,470
Bekah: Yeah.

511
00:30:25,194 --> 00:30:25,684
Kai: Yeah.

512
00:30:25,819 --> 00:30:28,009
Bekah: one of the things that can
be hard, no matter what kind of

513
00:30:28,009 --> 00:30:31,430
content you're creating, is to
learn how to not be precious

514
00:30:31,434 --> 00:30:35,059
about your content that you have
on the page. Right? Like when

515
00:30:35,065 --> 00:30:39,890
it's in rough draft stage, that's
a rough draft. And even though

516
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:45,349
you might like a particular part,
it might need to be cut, right?

517
00:30:45,605 --> 00:30:48,394
Kai: kill your darlings. It is
terrible. I hate it

518
00:30:48,829 --> 00:30:52,220
Bekah: Yeah, it's hard. I, I have
my, my talk that I gave

519
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:56,779
yesterday, and so I write out the
whole thing. I enjoy doing that.

520
00:30:56,779 --> 00:31:00,349
It helps me to focus and organize
and kind of see things

521
00:31:00,355 --> 00:31:04,430
differently. And then as I go
through, I start cutting those

522
00:31:04,434 --> 00:31:07,160
pieces, but I'll put them in
another document. Cause I'm like,

523
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,380
well, this might not be the end
of you forever.

524
00:31:09,575 --> 00:31:10,505
Kai: Same. I

525
00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:11,240
Bekah: place for you.

526
00:31:12,605 --> 00:31:14,464
Kai: and if it's a different
talk, you know, like

527
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,410
Bekah: Yeah. Yeah. So is that
like kind of your process? Like

528
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:21,710
what does your process for
content creation look like from

529
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:22,220
start to.

530
00:31:23,255 --> 00:31:26,884
Kai: So, um, first of all, I
don't get writer's block because

531
00:31:27,005 --> 00:31:29,765
the way I started out in
journalism, you don't have

532
00:31:29,765 --> 00:31:32,855
writer's block. If you have
writer's block, the paper doesn't

533
00:31:32,855 --> 00:31:36,214
go out the next day. So the first
time I was like, oh, I dunno what

534
00:31:36,214 --> 00:31:40,144
to write. I think my, my editor
back then was like, you just sit

535
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:42,244
down, you write something and
then you work on it. So that is,

536
00:31:43,144 --> 00:31:47,674
I've been offering one-on-ones
to, uh, to devs to help them if

537
00:31:47,674 --> 00:31:50,654
they wanna get into writing more.
and the, the first thing I always

538
00:31:50,654 --> 00:31:54,555
say is just put something down.
Um, do not put the heading down.

539
00:31:54,555 --> 00:31:57,644
Like if you're writing a blog
post or an article, you write the

540
00:31:57,644 --> 00:32:00,704
headline last. And I think that's
something that people outside of

541
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:03,974
journalism maybe don't always
know, but it's incredibly helpful

542
00:32:03,974 --> 00:32:07,575
because you gotta write the story
to know what like the point of

543
00:32:07,575 --> 00:32:12,015
the story is, and then you can
create the headline. So I'm, I'm

544
00:32:12,015 --> 00:32:15,105
a recovering perfectionist, I
would say. I think that's

545
00:32:15,105 --> 00:32:18,494
probably the best way to describe
it. And over the years I've

546
00:32:18,494 --> 00:32:23,174
learned to just live with that
first draft. Just put it down no

547
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:26,865
matter how cringe. And, uh, just
put it down, leave it, come back

548
00:32:26,865 --> 00:32:31,305
to it another day and put your
editor's hat on and then go

549
00:32:31,305 --> 00:32:34,454
through it as your edit. Like,
just pretend you're your editor

550
00:32:35,805 --> 00:32:41,130
Um, and I think that's, That's
the best way. Sometimes,

551
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:44,759
sometimes I sit down and write a
blog post from top to bottom, and

552
00:32:44,765 --> 00:32:47,700
it's perfect the way it is. Like
obviously editing a little bit,

553
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,549
but like it's perfect and other
times the right one. And just

554
00:32:50,555 --> 00:32:52,829
like with the talk, it just
doesn't, it just doesn't sit well

555
00:32:52,829 --> 00:32:56,910
with me and I then I start, then
I start futzing with the

556
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:01,049
structure and pushing things up
and down and around, and I try

557
00:33:01,049 --> 00:33:04,529
not to copy. Stuff that I wanna
keep in into a different document

558
00:33:04,529 --> 00:33:07,380
because then I'll get confused.
But yeah, I've done a, I've done

559
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:13,424
a lot of command X command V. In
a document, if someone were to

560
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:15,615
look over my shoulder, they'd
probably get dizzy. Like I've

561
00:33:15,615 --> 00:33:18,765
actually edited other people's
work and tried to be like,

562
00:33:18,765 --> 00:33:21,704
gentle. And then I just like, no,
just do you thing. And then they

563
00:33:21,704 --> 00:33:23,325
look over my shoulder and they're
like, what the hell are you

564
00:33:23,325 --> 00:33:25,785
doing? It's like, just wait. Just
wait for it. It's, it's gonna be

565
00:33:25,785 --> 00:33:27,765
good in the end and just need to
figure out how this works. It's

566
00:33:27,765 --> 00:33:31,904
like a puzzle. I think sometimes,
so yeah, sometimes you just write

567
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:34,934
a thing and other times you have
to write a structure first

568
00:33:34,934 --> 00:33:38,595
because you need that to, to sort
your thoughts. And sometimes none

569
00:33:38,595 --> 00:33:42,914
of this works and you have a
messed up puzzle that you have to

570
00:33:43,184 --> 00:33:45,555
put back together in the end or
put together.

571
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,596
Bekah: you've talked a little bit
about mentoring other people

572
00:33:48,596 --> 00:33:52,226
through that journey too, and
working on other, working on

573
00:33:52,226 --> 00:33:55,705
content with other people. So
what do you think some of the

574
00:33:55,705 --> 00:33:58,465
most important moments for you
have been as a mentor?

575
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:02,711
Kai: I mean, I dunno if I would
call as myself a mentor at this

576
00:34:02,711 --> 00:34:08,050
point. Um, it's just, uh, I
really like when I can help

577
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:14,201
people, like when I can see that,
what I tell them. That to me

578
00:34:14,201 --> 00:34:18,565
maybe seems insignificant because
I've been doing it for. 20 years

579
00:34:18,565 --> 00:34:22,916
at this point. Um, to me it seems
insignificant, but to them it's

580
00:34:22,916 --> 00:34:25,525
like, oh, I had never thought of
it that way, because they're not,

581
00:34:25,556 --> 00:34:29,905
they don't have my history and my
experience in writing. So to them

582
00:34:29,911 --> 00:34:32,485
it's a new thing. And it's maybe
the one thing that like loosens

583
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:36,385
that guardian knot that they had,
why they couldn't get the writing

584
00:34:36,385 --> 00:34:40,213
done the way they wanted to. And
also sometimes, like honestly,

585
00:34:40,273 --> 00:34:43,452
half the time when I talk to
people, they think they're so bad

586
00:34:43,452 --> 00:34:46,963
and they send me something and
I'm. You're not actually bad.

587
00:34:47,052 --> 00:34:50,353
Like it's fine. You can get
better, but you're not bad. I've

588
00:34:50,353 --> 00:34:54,012
seen bad you're not bad. And then
sometimes that's all they need.

589
00:34:54,018 --> 00:34:57,552
Just someone to tell them that
it's okay, and to give them the

590
00:34:57,557 --> 00:35:02,472
confidence to just do it. Like
basically just what people have

591
00:35:02,682 --> 00:35:05,322
have done with me when I started
coding. She's like, just, you're

592
00:35:05,322 --> 00:35:08,112
gonna be fine. Just do it.
There's really nothing you can

593
00:35:08,233 --> 00:35:14,532
lose I just really like seeing
that whatever innate thing my

594
00:35:14,532 --> 00:35:17,773
brain comes up with that I think
surely that won't help anyone,

595
00:35:17,773 --> 00:35:22,782
then actually helps people. I'm
like, oh, huh, interesting. Cool.

596
00:35:23,652 --> 00:35:27,242
Guess I did learn something in
this 20 odd year com career.

597
00:35:27,956 --> 00:35:33,909
Bekah: Yeah, I think that. We
often undervalue ourselves and

598
00:35:33,909 --> 00:35:38,380
our experiences and just kind of
like what you were saying before,

599
00:35:38,385 --> 00:35:42,579
what works for one person or what
might be meaningful for one

600
00:35:42,579 --> 00:35:46,869
person won't be for another
person. So I think that anytime

601
00:35:46,869 --> 00:35:50,500
there's that self-doubt in there
or thinking like this won't be

602
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:55,045
helpful, it probably will be
helpful to somebody. it just

603
00:35:55,045 --> 00:35:58,494
might not seem like that would be
helpful to you because you know,

604
00:35:58,494 --> 00:36:01,255
maybe that's not your style or
maybe there's some self-doubt

605
00:36:01,255 --> 00:36:04,824
that's really holding you back
from seeing the value in the

606
00:36:04,824 --> 00:36:05,724
things that you're doing.

607
00:36:06,594 --> 00:36:09,925
Kai: Or also because I've just
forgotten that 20 years ago, that

608
00:36:09,925 --> 00:36:13,914
has helped me as well, and it's,
it's also nice to, to be reminded

609
00:36:13,914 --> 00:36:15,554
of how far you've come, I guess.

610
00:36:16,329 --> 00:36:19,900
Bekah: Yeah. I love that. That's
super important. So, uh, right

611
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:26,590
now you are about to transition
into a full-time role. How are

612
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:27,039
you feeling

613
00:36:27,144 --> 00:36:28,264
Kai: Part-time. Part-time.

614
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:29,349
Bekah: Oh, part-time,

615
00:36:29,704 --> 00:36:30,985
Kai: part-time. That was

616
00:36:31,179 --> 00:36:32,590
Bekah: a not self-employed role.

617
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:37,474
Kai: Yeah, so I, um, being
self-employed in Germany is not

618
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:41,394
something I enjoy, and since I've
been doing the same kind of work

619
00:36:41,394 --> 00:36:44,695
for the past couple of years, I
also kind of wanted another

620
00:36:44,695 --> 00:36:50,215
challenge and to segue into Dev
or to sidestep into Dev, I knew

621
00:36:50,215 --> 00:36:55,045
that I, I would have to probably
become employed. I feel really

622
00:36:55,045 --> 00:36:59,650
weird about it. So I start at the
beginning of. First week of

623
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:03,519
February. Um, and it's four days
a week, luckily, and the company

624
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:07,989
seems really nice, but I'm still
like this teeny tiny bit. Like

625
00:37:07,989 --> 00:37:12,039
I'm super excited, but I'm also
slightly apprehensive because the

626
00:37:12,039 --> 00:37:16,030
past eight and a half years when
my boss was shit, it was me, you

627
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:23,394
know? Um, and I was lucky enough
to. Have worked in, in a pretty

628
00:37:23,394 --> 00:37:26,545
niche position, so I, I could
really set my own rates. I didn't

629
00:37:26,545 --> 00:37:30,864
have to work long hours. Um, I
don't think else only have to

630
00:37:30,869 --> 00:37:34,014
work long hours in this job. They
seem really cool. But there's,

631
00:37:34,074 --> 00:37:38,994
um, there's also a lot of, I
think, a lot of trauma involved

632
00:37:38,994 --> 00:37:41,514
for me with regards to
employment. So the last time I

633
00:37:41,514 --> 00:37:47,186
was employed was. 2014. Um, and
before that I, I had a really

634
00:37:47,186 --> 00:37:53,246
hard time finding the right jobs.
Um, staying employed long enough,

635
00:37:53,306 --> 00:37:59,005
my ADHD always got bored with the
jobs that I could get. Um, and

636
00:37:59,005 --> 00:38:04,496
then when I started working,
self-employed, I was, uh, I knew

637
00:38:04,496 --> 00:38:07,706
I wanted to start my own business
and I was looking for a part-time

638
00:38:07,706 --> 00:38:12,865
job to tide me over and like kind
of start gently on the side. And

639
00:38:12,925 --> 00:38:14,786
all the jobs I applied for,
people were like, I'm sorry,

640
00:38:14,786 --> 00:38:17,726
you're overqualified. Or Why do
you only wanna work part-time?

641
00:38:17,726 --> 00:38:21,445
That's super weird. What's wrong
with you? But that was all

642
00:38:21,686 --> 00:38:26,255
outside of the street
technically. Um, and I realized,

643
00:38:27,295 --> 00:38:32,081
in tech, things are much better
today. We so many people I know,

644
00:38:32,085 --> 00:38:35,351
especially integral, so many
people I know work, uh, part-time

645
00:38:35,951 --> 00:38:40,090
in some way, shape or form. Uh,
so many people working companies

646
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:46,690
that are actually not toxic. Um,
but still in, in my head, this

647
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:49,721
like, or right down my head in my
heart, this feeling is still in

648
00:38:49,721 --> 00:38:54,550
there of all those bad
experiences, 10 years ago. That I

649
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:59,260
got away from because I became my
own boss. And um, so if a client

650
00:38:59,831 --> 00:39:03,701
seemed like a potential client,
seemed they weren't gonna be

651
00:39:03,701 --> 00:39:07,061
good, then I wouldn't take them.
I have a disclaimer on my website

652
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:11,681
that says I don't work with
bigots. Like I literally picked

653
00:39:11,681 --> 00:39:18,130
my, picked my client's chair,
pick them, and. Yeah, and I think

654
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:21,851
also being self-employed became
part of my identity in a way of

655
00:39:21,851 --> 00:39:25,300
my professional identity because
it's the, that, that's when I

656
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:28,240
started having success in my
career and building a career. And

657
00:39:29,411 --> 00:39:35,005
it's odd to let go of that a bit.
but also it just, it was just a

658
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:38,396
step. It's, it's fine. I have a
portfolio career. I've done so

659
00:39:38,396 --> 00:39:42,025
many different things in my life,
including working at a gym and

660
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:47,096
making crepe and selling soup,
and I was a video editor at some

661
00:39:47,096 --> 00:39:49,436
point, an assistant, and like,
I've done so many different

662
00:39:49,436 --> 00:39:52,916
things. I shouldn't, I shouldn't
be scared of change, but this, it

663
00:39:52,916 --> 00:39:56,936
feels like, like I'm giving up a
teeny tiny part of my identity,

664
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:58,436
which is silly, but that's

665
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:02,126
Dan: It's not, it's not silly.
It's not silly at all. I, I mean,

666
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:05,666
I've been independent for, you
know, I don't know, whatever it

667
00:40:05,666 --> 00:40:11,766
is, 15, 20 years, something like
15, whatever, long time and, um,

668
00:40:13,005 --> 00:40:15,235
and I totally follow what you
were saying. And I've also, I

669
00:40:15,235 --> 00:40:20,036
mean, I've almost, I've only ever
actually applied to one job, but

670
00:40:20,036 --> 00:40:21,985
I've, I've al I thought about it
a bunch of times, you know what I

671
00:40:21,985 --> 00:40:25,135
mean? And it's, there's that,
like, there's that part of ADHD

672
00:40:25,135 --> 00:40:27,746
thing that it's like, I wanna
stay where I'm comfortable, but

673
00:40:27,746 --> 00:40:30,056
there's also the, like, I'm
bored. Let's like, oh, here's a

674
00:40:30,056 --> 00:40:31,726
new shiny thing. You know what I
mean? And I

675
00:40:31,956 --> 00:40:34,326
Kai: when you're self-employed,
you can follow the shiny thing

676
00:40:34,326 --> 00:40:35,076
easier.

677
00:40:35,405 --> 00:40:38,496
Dan: Which is, which is yes, yes,
yes. Absolutely. Uh, which is

678
00:40:38,675 --> 00:40:42,516
what I, one of the things I, I
love about it. Um, uh, but like

679
00:40:42,576 --> 00:40:44,916
that being said, in the tech
world, I, there's new shiny

680
00:40:44,916 --> 00:40:49,295
things all the time, And so even
if you're, uh, working for the

681
00:40:49,295 --> 00:40:51,846
same, I mean, I have a client
that I've had for that whole

682
00:40:51,876 --> 00:40:55,076
time, the 15, 16 years. With
especially front end development.

683
00:40:55,076 --> 00:40:58,990
It's like there's, there's new
shiny stuff, all the time. I was

684
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:01,840
wondering what, um, you said
there's something about being

685
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:05,201
independent in Germany that you
didn't like. Is that tax tax

686
00:41:05,201 --> 00:41:06,070
stuff or is it,

687
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:10,150
Kai: Yeah, the overhead is, um,
so I hated it in Austria. Um, and

688
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:15,161
then we moved to Scotland and for
five years, or I was blissfully

689
00:41:16,271 --> 00:41:19,240
like, I just forgot the bad
things in Austria that are the

690
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:22,331
same things that are in Germany,
like in the uk I could just, I

691
00:41:22,331 --> 00:41:26,411
could do my own taxes. I used a,
um, like the bookkeeping program

692
00:41:26,411 --> 00:41:31,195
I used that, I wrote my, my
invoices with automatically. Um,

693
00:41:31,315 --> 00:41:33,746
collated everything at the end of
the year. Just had to go through

694
00:41:33,746 --> 00:41:36,885
it, add a few things, fix a few
things, and then like directly

695
00:41:36,891 --> 00:41:39,175
send it to the HMRC, like
literally from within the

696
00:41:39,175 --> 00:41:43,646
program. Fantastic. Here in
Germany, first of all, I was

697
00:41:43,646 --> 00:41:47,311
immediately push into the VAT
range because so if you're in the

698
00:41:47,311 --> 00:41:51,541
uk, if you are a self-employed
sole trader, um, so you're not a

699
00:41:51,541 --> 00:41:55,110
company but a sole trader, if you
earn more than 82,000 pounds a

700
00:41:55,115 --> 00:41:58,981
year, then you have to do that.
Otherwise, you don't have to do

701
00:41:58,981 --> 00:42:01,920
that. You're a small business
owner in

702
00:42:02,085 --> 00:42:02,476
Dan: Can you tell

703
00:42:02,521 --> 00:42:05,130
Kai: uh, uh, uh, a val value add
tax.

704
00:42:05,646 --> 00:42:08,016
Dan: Okay. All right, so it's
just more taxes.

705
00:42:08,451 --> 00:42:10,621
Kai: It's something that goes in
and comes out and actually you

706
00:42:10,626 --> 00:42:14,360
don't lose or win any money with
it, but it's extra work. So in

707
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:18,021
the UK I could easily avoid that.
In Germany, the limit is far

708
00:42:18,021 --> 00:42:21,170
lower. It's at, I think, 30,000
euros. So I was immediately

709
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:24,740
pushed into that range, which
means that now four times a year

710
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:31,521
I have to do this. Um, VAT tax
thing. I've done it four or five

711
00:42:31,521 --> 00:42:36,920
times at this point. And, um, I
think the first three times I

712
00:42:36,925 --> 00:42:42,110
cried because, like literally
cried because it is complicated

713
00:42:42,141 --> 00:42:48,351
and the bookkeeping programs here
are shite also because like the,

714
00:42:48,411 --> 00:42:53,840
the actual laws around it are far
too complicated. Um, so like,

715
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:58,130
Suddenly I was, I was working the
same amount. I was earning about

716
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:02,780
the same amount. Uh, but I also
had to do VAT tax shit, uh, four

717
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:08,360
times a year. And then I also
actually got less out of my

718
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:12,050
earnings because in the UK I just
put 20% aside for taxes and

719
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:16,670
insurance and it was fine. Here I
put one fourth of what I, what

720
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:19,780
comes in immediately gets put
aside for. I hope it's gonna be

721
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:22,721
enough. I don't know if it's
gonna be enough. We'll see. Um,

722
00:43:22,721 --> 00:43:26,501
and then I pay insurance, which
is about 670 years a month for.

723
00:43:27,081 --> 00:43:30,920
And then I also put money aside
so that I can pay the tax advisor

724
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:34,701
that I need at the end of the
year because there's no way I'm

725
00:43:34,701 --> 00:43:37,851
tackling that on my own. Like
the, the VAT thing was already

726
00:43:37,856 --> 00:43:42,170
difficult enough, so it kind of
just sucks the joy out of it.

727
00:43:42,891 --> 00:43:46,041
Also, cuz I can, I can literally
not save any money. I earn the

728
00:43:46,041 --> 00:43:50,030
same amount and I cannot save any
money. And it's just, yeah, I was

729
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:52,400
just done with it, I

730
00:43:52,806 --> 00:43:55,085
Dan: Yeah, yeah. No, I mean, I
totally get it there. I mean,

731
00:43:55,085 --> 00:43:57,465
there's a bunch of pain in the
butt stuff, uh,

732
00:43:57,501 --> 00:44:01,010
Kai: But I think it's, it's e
easy, like it's less bureaucratic

733
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:04,940
in the US isn't it? Like taxes
are the same for whether you're a

734
00:44:04,945 --> 00:44:08,271
business owner or not, or am I,
am I mistaken on that

735
00:44:08,786 --> 00:44:13,175
Dan: I, taxes are complicated.
And I try not to pay too much

736
00:44:13,175 --> 00:44:16,775
attention to it. Um, I, I mean, I
pay somebody to do it a as well,

737
00:44:16,775 --> 00:44:19,835
you know, and they, they just
tell me the things to do, and I

738
00:44:19,835 --> 00:44:22,865
trust that they are, are
accurate. Um,

739
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:25,101
Kai: if we were to move back to
the uk, I would easily do it

740
00:44:25,101 --> 00:44:28,371
myself again. But, um, I'm not
gonna be self-employed in Germany

741
00:44:28,371 --> 00:44:30,231
or Australia again in my life.
Thank you very

742
00:44:30,471 --> 00:44:33,590
Dan: Um, yeah, no, I mean,
that's, that's totally fair. I,

743
00:44:33,681 --> 00:44:36,081
uh, and if, yeah, if it got much
more complicated than this, I

744
00:44:36,085 --> 00:44:39,891
would, I then it is now for me, I
would, I would certainly, uh,

745
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,550
struggle with that too. That tax
stuff just makes my brain shut

746
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:46,610
down every time. Like, all the
the businessy stuff around

747
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:49,521
running a business. I, I don't
actually enjoy, you know, even

748
00:44:49,521 --> 00:44:53,346
though I've been self-employed
for so long. I know enough to get

749
00:44:53,346 --> 00:44:58,115
by and I haven't gotten audited
or anything like that, But, uh,

750
00:44:58,206 --> 00:45:00,695
you know, other than that, it's,
it's a struggle for sure. It's

751
00:45:00,695 --> 00:45:03,666
definitely one of the big
downsides, uh, of being

752
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:04,025
independent.

753
00:45:04,971 --> 00:45:05,601
Kai: definitely.

754
00:45:06,965 --> 00:45:10,295
Dan: Uh, so that's exciting. So
your new role is Dev,

755
00:45:11,271 --> 00:45:13,641
Kai: No, um, not technically. Uh,
actually I'm gonna be in the

756
00:45:13,641 --> 00:45:17,300
content department. Um, so I'm
officially, I think it's content

757
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:23,721
marketing manager, but I will
also be teaching developers to

758
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:25,851
write better. So that is
something that I'm really, really

759
00:45:25,856 --> 00:45:30,561
excited about with this role. And
it's, I think it's, I. Probably.

760
00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:33,260
So at first I was just like
interviewing and talking to them

761
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:36,831
and everything, and that part
came up and I was like, oh wait,

762
00:45:36,831 --> 00:45:41,090
that is exactly what I wanna do.
That is, yeah. So I mean, I guess

763
00:45:41,096 --> 00:45:44,481
technically it's developer
education, so I think it'll be,

764
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:48,831
uh, a good stepping stone into
Dev proper. But like I, I only

765
00:45:48,835 --> 00:45:51,681
heard about Dev I think a year
ago, like before that. I didn't

766
00:45:51,681 --> 00:45:54,351
really realize what it was like.
I had a few friends who were in

767
00:45:54,351 --> 00:45:56,541
Devel, but no one ever bothered
to explain to me what they were

768
00:45:56,541 --> 00:45:57,891
doing. And

769
00:45:58,161 --> 00:46:00,010
Bekah: I think, I think it's
probably because nobody really

770
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:00,731
knows what they're doing.

771
00:46:01,251 --> 00:46:01,581
Kai: And then

772
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,090
Bekah: I say that as a Debra
person, and so.

773
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:08,541
Kai: and then a year ago was, I
was talking to my friend, uh,

774
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:11,030
Ramon, who's also in Virtual
Coffee, and we've been friends

775
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:14,916
for a few years and he was like,
um, actually Kai. Because I was

776
00:46:14,916 --> 00:46:16,596
complaining about being
self-employed cause it was a

777
00:46:16,596 --> 00:46:20,405
headache and a half. Um, and he
was like, you know, Kai, all

778
00:46:20,405 --> 00:46:23,826
these like skills that you
already have, minus coding is

779
00:46:23,826 --> 00:46:27,096
pretty much never, why didn't you
go into that? And I started

780
00:46:27,096 --> 00:46:31,085
looking into it and that's when
I, yeah, basically pivoted a bit

781
00:46:31,085 --> 00:46:34,985
and read my website. Kind of
started networking more, joined

782
00:46:34,985 --> 00:46:38,405
some, some communities and
started like casually

783
00:46:38,405 --> 00:46:41,186
interviewing, talking to a few
people. I got really lucky. I, I

784
00:46:41,186 --> 00:46:44,721
had. Had a few casual
conversations, two proper

785
00:46:44,721 --> 00:46:49,340
interview, like tracks with
companies and, and that was it.

786
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:52,221
And then I landed this, uh,
within like, uh, I think maybe

787
00:46:52,221 --> 00:46:56,840
nine months or so. So that's
pretty cool. But yeah, I just.

788
00:46:57,481 --> 00:47:00,425
It's just funny cuz I found out I
had all these skills and

789
00:47:00,425 --> 00:47:03,726
interests and they all came
together endeavor. And I had no

790
00:47:03,726 --> 00:47:08,405
idea this was there, And I think
that's also what what makes me

791
00:47:08,405 --> 00:47:10,596
feel a lot better about like,
stepping away from being

792
00:47:10,601 --> 00:47:13,115
self-employed because this, I
don't feel like I'm leaving

793
00:47:13,115 --> 00:47:16,416
anything behind. I can bring like
my whole self to the table, all

794
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:20,396
my, all my skills, all these like
random things like. I used to be

795
00:47:20,396 --> 00:47:22,885
a video editor. I enjoy public
speaking. I'm one of the sweet

796
00:47:22,885 --> 00:47:25,436
people who enjoys public
speaking. I know. Um, I love

797
00:47:25,436 --> 00:47:27,536
networking. I love talking to
people. I love interviewing

798
00:47:27,536 --> 00:47:30,565
people. I also love writing and
create, you know, and it all kind

799
00:47:30,565 --> 00:47:33,056
of comes together. And now turns
out, I also enjoy coding. So

800
00:47:33,056 --> 00:47:35,726
that's kind of cool and
convenient. I'm, I'm glad it

801
00:47:35,731 --> 00:47:36,626
turned out this way. And

802
00:47:38,211 --> 00:47:40,581
Bekah: Yeah. That's awesome.
Somebody asked me at the

803
00:47:40,581 --> 00:47:45,382
conference I was just at, how I
knew that I should get into

804
00:47:45,382 --> 00:47:50,331
Deval, I think, and how I did it.
I was like, I, I didn't, um,

805
00:47:50,822 --> 00:47:53,121
somebody just told me I should,
and then I was like, oh, I

806
00:47:53,121 --> 00:47:55,492
suppose I am doing all of those
things right.

807
00:47:55,507 --> 00:48:00,036
Kai: So that is how it goes.
Interesting. That's good to know.

808
00:48:00,041 --> 00:48:04,327
Good to know. Like, yeah, get
friend who's like, you should be

809
00:48:04,327 --> 00:48:05,106
doing this.

810
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:09,786
Bekah: Right. I, and even
thinking about backgrounds, I

811
00:48:09,791 --> 00:48:12,786
really love how devel lends
itself to non-traditional

812
00:48:12,791 --> 00:48:17,675
backgrounds too, because a lot of
us have come from doing things

813
00:48:17,675 --> 00:48:20,585
like writing or teaching, and
these are all skills that you

814
00:48:20,585 --> 00:48:23,706
need. You have to be a good
communicator, right? And all

815
00:48:23,706 --> 00:48:28,835
those years of experience in
communicating. Lends itself to

816
00:48:29,106 --> 00:48:33,335
Dev as you learn new things and,
and you're better able to explain

817
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:35,885
that to the people that you're
working with.

818
00:48:36,925 --> 00:48:42,155
Kai: I'm really hoping that. as
more people like us end up in

819
00:48:42,155 --> 00:48:47,045
Dev. Maybe also the, the job spec
specs will get rewritten a bit

820
00:48:47,045 --> 00:48:51,635
because I do understand that like
the technical knowledge is

821
00:48:51,641 --> 00:48:55,056
important. Like, yes, you need to
learn a code, but I also think

822
00:48:55,056 --> 00:48:58,115
you can learn a code. It is, it
is much harder to teach someone

823
00:48:58,206 --> 00:49:02,210
to communicate. When, like,
obviously we've all learned to

824
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:05,420
communicate well, but it's, it's
been the lifetime process often

825
00:49:05,871 --> 00:49:10,820
and to write well and to create
content well. And, um, yeah, I'm,

826
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:13,670
I'm really hoping that the, the
tide will change a little bit. I

827
00:49:13,675 --> 00:49:17,240
feel like it already is with some
projects that, that really

828
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:22,911
support career changes and
everything. But yeah, it's still

829
00:49:22,911 --> 00:49:27,081
very often it's like when I was
looking through job apps, like

830
00:49:27,081 --> 00:49:31,251
job ads, very often I would get
to the tech requirements and it

831
00:49:31,251 --> 00:49:33,860
was an absolute must have, this,
this, this, and this. And I was

832
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:37,101
like, Hmm, yeah, I don't have
that. I could probably, um, but

833
00:49:37,101 --> 00:49:40,081
right now I don't have that. And
then I just didn't, I didn't

834
00:49:40,085 --> 00:49:44,481
bother applying to jobs where
that was hammered home so much. I

835
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:46,371
think. And I hope that changes.

836
00:49:46,951 --> 00:49:48,360
Bekah: Yeah, absolutely. I.

837
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,610
Kai: maybe once the comm, once
the economy is better, but

838
00:49:51,619 --> 00:49:54,811
Bekah: Right. Yeah. That's a
challenge right now. Well, Kai,

839
00:49:54,811 --> 00:49:57,992
we wanna thank you for being here
with us today. I've got one more

840
00:49:58,501 --> 00:50:01,831
question for you, and that's, if
you can describe yourself with

841
00:50:01,836 --> 00:50:05,192
one word, what would that one
word be and why?

842
00:50:06,646 --> 00:50:10,246
Kai: Um, I think the word would
be curious because that curiosity

843
00:50:10,246 --> 00:50:14,327
has been. What's been driving me
all these years with everything,

844
00:50:14,327 --> 00:50:17,476
like, everything new I learn.
Yeah, the ADHD wants the new

845
00:50:17,476 --> 00:50:20,896
shiny, but also I'm very curious
to learn new things. I love

846
00:50:20,896 --> 00:50:24,887
learning new things. Curiosity is
what makes me good at

847
00:50:24,887 --> 00:50:28,936
interviewing people and writing
about them and writing about new

848
00:50:28,936 --> 00:50:35,777
things. And yeah, I think I, I
don't think curiosity killed the

849
00:50:35,777 --> 00:50:40,336
cat. Come to think of it, I think
curiosity is a really good thing

850
00:50:40,336 --> 00:50:40,817
to have.

851
00:50:41,536 --> 00:50:43,606
Bekah: Yeah. I love that. That
was great. And I think that

852
00:50:43,606 --> 00:50:46,217
everything that you talked about
today really captures that.

853
00:50:46,681 --> 00:50:47,192
Kai: I am glad

854
00:50:47,987 --> 00:50:50,746
Bekah: Well, thanks so much for,
for being here with us today and

855
