00:00:07,001 --> 00:00:11,861
Bekah: Hello, and welcome to
Season seven, episode four of

I'm Bekah, and this is a podcast

3
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:20,009
that features members of the
Virtual Coffee community.

4
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:23,219
Virtual Coffee is an intimate
group of developers at all

5
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:26,219
stages of their coding journey,
and they're here on this podcast

6
00:00:26,224 --> 00:00:28,739
sharing their stories and what
they've learned, and we're

7
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:32,219
here to share it with you.
Here with me today

8
00:00:30,178 --> 00:00:32,219
is my co-host Dan.

9
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:34,558
Dan: What up back?
How's it going?

10
00:00:35,293 --> 00:00:36,973
Bekah: it is going amazing.

11
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:41,969
Dan: Nice. Yes.
Uh, so is it still

00:00:39,418 --> 00:00:43,154
70 degrees and sunny?
Where you are.

13
00:00:43,514 --> 00:00:46,154
Bekah: It is 70 degrees in Sunny.
It is very

14
00:00:46,274 --> 00:00:47,834
Dan: It is sunny here.
It's actually nice.

15
00:00:47,834 --> 00:00:49,543
I was complaining about the
weather earlier today, but,

16
00:00:49,573 --> 00:00:55,003
uh, it is like 50, but it's
sunny, which that is, uh, you

17
00:00:55,003 --> 00:01:00,164
know, , that's a, that's a good
thing, uh, in my mind anyway.

18
00:01:00,223 --> 00:01:00,554
I like the

19
00:01:00,673 --> 00:01:03,914
Bekah: is nice.
Yeah, sunny, just like this

20
00:01:01,423 --> 00:01:08,203
episode was really sunny.
I felt really warm and

21
00:01:03,914 --> 00:01:08,203
happy while we recorded it.

22
00:01:08,653 --> 00:01:09,674
Dan: Was an awesome segue.

23
00:01:09,924 --> 00:01:10,644
Bekah: Thank you.

24
00:01:11,293 --> 00:01:15,403
Dan: Yeah. Uh oh.
Speaking of sunny

25
00:01:12,463 --> 00:01:20,203
conversations, uh, yeah.
Today we talked with,

26
00:01:15,403 --> 00:01:20,953
uh, , um, and yes, had
a great conversation.

27
00:01:20,953 --> 00:01:26,384
She is a delight to talk to.
Um, and we talked about a lot

28
00:01:23,563 --> 00:01:29,804
about, uh, open source and about
her journey, you know, becoming

29
00:01:26,384 --> 00:01:32,924
a developer and, um, all of
the amazing work she did during

30
00:01:29,804 --> 00:01:36,073
Octoberfest this past year.
Uh, she, she topped

31
00:01:32,983 --> 00:01:39,554
our leaderboards.
I looked it up during the

32
00:01:37,394 --> 00:01:41,834
podcast now I can't remember,
what was it, ten nine?

33
00:01:41,864 --> 00:01:43,694
I think it was more than,
I think it was more than we

34
00:01:43,694 --> 00:01:44,713
thought after I looked it up.

35
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:45,269
Bekah: yeah,

36
00:01:46,213 --> 00:01:46,603
Dan: anyway,

37
00:01:46,638 --> 00:01:47,039
Bekah: even number.

38
00:01:47,644 --> 00:01:49,004
Dan: yeah. Yeah. Okay.
Eight or 10.

39
00:01:49,243 --> 00:01:51,433
Anyway, she had an incredible
amount of poor requests

40
00:01:51,493 --> 00:01:55,123
during Octoberfest and, um,
yeah, she hit like her, her

41
00:01:55,123 --> 00:01:59,174
four or whatever that we
wanted for Heover Fest really

42
00:01:59,233 --> 00:02:01,424
early, I think, and then
just kept the ball rolling.

43
00:02:01,483 --> 00:02:02,263
It was really cool to see.

44
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:05,774
Bekah: Yeah, she was a first
time open source contributor

45
00:02:05,774 --> 00:02:09,493
and she contributed to my
postpartum wellness app, and

46
00:02:09,493 --> 00:02:12,253
I got to work with her as a
mentor this year, but she did

47
00:02:12,253 --> 00:02:16,364
not really need any mentoring.
She was just tearing

48
00:02:13,574 --> 00:02:20,114
up the issues.
It was so fun to watch, and she

49
00:02:16,364 --> 00:02:24,373
just kept going and it was, I, I
felt really energized by seeing

50
00:02:20,114 --> 00:02:27,044
her do all of the contributions
during octoberfest and during

51
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:27,044
our conversation today too.

52
00:02:28,033 --> 00:02:32,174
Dan: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
I mean, and it's like she's,

53
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:34,933
she has that, um, I don't
know that any like thing that

54
00:02:32,179 --> 00:02:37,274
you lots of times want to
see in developers where they,

55
00:02:34,933 --> 00:02:39,524
where they enjoy it a little
bit, , you know, and they,

56
00:02:37,274 --> 00:02:43,093
they kind of keep, keep going.
She, um, and, and with

57
00:02:39,528 --> 00:02:45,014
open source, I feel like
the people that contribute

58
00:02:43,093 --> 00:02:45,824
often to open source, that's
a pretty common thing.

59
00:02:45,854 --> 00:02:50,234
Um, and, you know, if you're
not paid, You have to find time

60
00:02:50,234 --> 00:02:54,973
and, and, and do it on your own.
And, um, uh, it's one of

61
00:02:51,433 --> 00:02:57,044
the, one of the many, many
reasons I love Hector Fest

62
00:02:54,973 --> 00:02:59,294
because it, it, it helps
people get over that initial

63
00:02:57,044 --> 00:03:01,873
hump of, of getting into it.
And, uh, and then sometimes

64
00:02:59,294 --> 00:03:05,713
you get end up with people
that, um, do it for, for

65
00:03:01,873 --> 00:03:05,713
their whole lives or whatever,

66
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:09,628
Bekah: Yeah, right.
I mean, you're really building a

67
00:03:06,929 --> 00:03:11,788
community at that point, right?
Like in an open source

68
00:03:09,628 --> 00:03:12,778
community, and it can be a
really great place to be.

69
00:03:13,388 --> 00:03:14,228
Dan: absolutely.

70
00:03:14,805 --> 00:03:17,354
Bekah: Well, we start every
episode of the podcast, like

71
00:03:17,354 --> 00:03:21,284
we start every Virtual Coffee,
we say our names, where we're

72
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:24,675
from, what we do, and answer
a random check-in question.

73
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:38,864
We hope you enjoy this episode.
Today's random check-in question

74
00:03:33,783 --> 00:03:40,645
is, who's your favorite hero?
My name is Bekah.

75
00:03:41,485 --> 00:03:45,444
I am a technical community
builder from a small

76
00:03:45,444 --> 00:03:54,324
town in Ohio, and I don't
know the answer to this.

77
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:57,444
Dan: Is this like fiction?
Fictional. Fictional hero.

78
00:03:57,745 --> 00:03:59,544
Bekah: I'm definitely
going with fictional.

79
00:03:59,814 --> 00:04:03,655
Dan: Okay, cool.
Yeah, because otherwise then

80
00:04:01,164 --> 00:04:05,604
you'd have to like probably
say your mom or your dad

81
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:06,895
or something and you know,
otherwise you'd feel guilty.

82
00:04:06,985 --> 00:04:07,194
All right.

83
00:04:07,254 --> 00:04:09,085
Bekah: I mean, but you can,
if you wanna say your mom

84
00:04:09,085 --> 00:04:15,294
and your dad, that's fine.
I'm gonna go with Wanda

85
00:04:10,944 --> 00:04:15,294
from, um, the Marvel.

86
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,430
Dan: She's a bad guy. Bekah,

87
00:04:19,014 --> 00:04:23,964
Bekah: She's a hero
in her own story, right?

88
00:04:25,089 --> 00:04:27,069
Dan: sure. So we're lots of

89
00:04:27,165 --> 00:04:27,324
Bekah: has

90
00:04:27,339 --> 00:04:27,819
Dan: people.

91
00:04:28,004 --> 00:04:32,004
Bekah: some heroic things. Or if

92
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:32,329
Dan: not recently.

93
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:37,555
Bekah: More fine, Sam
from Lord of the Rings. Okay.

94
00:04:37,915 --> 00:04:39,204
Feel very boring saying

95
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,740
Dan: Wise, he's a good.

96
00:04:42,487 --> 00:04:45,048
Bekah: All right.
Who's your, who's your

97
00:04:42,848 --> 00:04:45,048
excellent pick, Dan?

98
00:04:45,127 --> 00:04:48,158
Dan: uh, okay. Ho. Hi, I'm Dan.
I live in Cleveland.

99
00:04:48,367 --> 00:04:53,767
I, um, you know what I do
and gosh, I don't know.

100
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:58,120
Um, and see, I like if he
had, if I had time to like

101
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,980
really think, I probably
could pull out some like

102
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:03,490
interesting one, you know.
But like Han Solo is the one

103
00:05:01,269 --> 00:05:05,500
that comes to mind, and I
know, like, honestly, these

104
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:06,310
answers, I'm always like
making Star Wars things.

105
00:05:07,339 --> 00:05:09,834
It's like always the, you
know, first thing I think of.

106
00:05:10,404 --> 00:05:14,238
But, uh, yeah, Han Solo
is, my favorite because,

107
00:05:14,298 --> 00:05:14,959
you know, he, he,

108
00:05:15,009 --> 00:05:15,858
Bekah: a scoundrel.

109
00:05:15,978 --> 00:05:17,538
Dan: he's a scoundrel,
which I like.

110
00:05:17,569 --> 00:05:20,764
And also, um, whatever, he
didn't like set out trying to

111
00:05:20,764 --> 00:05:25,264
be hero, you know what I mean?
But like his heart told

112
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:27,125
him to do the right thing
and all that stuff, which,

113
00:05:25,264 --> 00:05:29,165
which I like, you know?
So that's my answer.

114
00:05:29,314 --> 00:05:29,795
I'm going Han.

115
00:05:30,694 --> 00:05:33,694
Aishwarya: hello.
So my name is Aishwarya

116
00:05:31,055 --> 00:05:35,555
. I'm from India.
I work as a front end developer.

117
00:05:35,975 --> 00:05:39,305
Uh, I mostly work with,
uh, react and recently

118
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:43,714
started with, react Native,
uh, and for me fictional.

119
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,680
Hero, are we going with
like a movie star or

120
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,490
something like that?

121
00:05:48,858 --> 00:05:49,488
Bekah: Could be.

122
00:05:49,863 --> 00:05:50,944
Dan: You could do
it however you want.

123
00:05:50,944 --> 00:05:52,923
Yeah, I was trying to think
of books and my mind went

124
00:05:52,923 --> 00:05:55,564
totally blank, but it.
It could be anything.

125
00:05:55,834 --> 00:05:56,853
It's you make the rules.

126
00:05:57,963 --> 00:06:01,533
Aishwarya: Okay, so I'm not
sure I remember his name,

127
00:06:01,593 --> 00:06:05,553
but the book is Me Before
You and he sort of helps.

128
00:06:05,553 --> 00:06:07,894
Sir, I can't remember
his name right now.

129
00:06:08,553 --> 00:06:10,233
And I love that
character very much.

130
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,149
Dan: Nice.

131
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,100
Aishwarya: It's a
movie plus book. Yeah,

132
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:14,329
Dan: Me. What was it?

133
00:06:15,055 --> 00:06:15,605
Bekah: Hey, before

134
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:16,399
Aishwarya: me before

135
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:17,959
Dan: before you. Nice. All right.

136
00:06:19,235 --> 00:06:20,254
Bekah: yeah, I'll have
to check that out.

137
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:23,134
I've definitely heard
about that before.

138
00:06:23,779 --> 00:06:26,060
And maybe we've about
it at Virtual Coffee.

139
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:30,560
Aishwarya: yes, he meets with
an accident and she's sort of

140
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,310
taking care of him and he pushes
to her towards her dreams.

141
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:37,528
Bekah: Oh, nice. Cool.
That sounds awesome.

142
00:06:37,528 --> 00:06:39,298
We'll have a link in the
show notes to that too.

143
00:06:39,329 --> 00:06:42,149
Um, so we wanna thank you so
much for being here, uh, with

144
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:46,918
us and on our season seven of
the Virtual Coffee Podcast.

145
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:50,728
And we always like to get
started with Origin Story.

146
00:06:50,728 --> 00:06:54,358
So before you jump in and let
us know what your origin story

147
00:06:54,363 --> 00:06:58,259
is, how you got to this point
in your career, what is one

148
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,468
word that describes your career?

149
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:05,538
Aishwarya: I'd say a bit
difficult or evolving.

150
00:07:06,649 --> 00:07:11,718
Uh, everything is changing.
You get to a point where

151
00:07:08,809 --> 00:07:13,968
you are like, okay, so
I have a hang on this.

152
00:07:14,358 --> 00:07:18,139
But, but, uh, at a certain
point it just, uh, spans

153
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:20,649
you and it is just evolv.

154
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:22,757
Bekah: uh, that
resonates with me a lot.

155
00:07:22,757 --> 00:07:24,797
I like that.
That's a really good one.

156
00:07:25,096 --> 00:07:28,396
So tell us a little bit
about this evolving journey

157
00:07:28,396 --> 00:07:34,456
that you've been on.
So how did you get started

158
00:07:29,237 --> 00:07:37,726
doing computery things and where
you are to get, and how did

159
00:07:34,456 --> 00:07:37,726
you get to where you are now?

160
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:45,088
Aishwarya: Okay, so my stories.
, same old school actually,

161
00:07:41,608 --> 00:07:46,559
I've done my engineering,
uh, in computer science.

162
00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:50,608
And, uh, I wasn't that
involved in coding back then,

163
00:07:51,059 --> 00:07:55,559
but, uh, then at one point,
I think, I remember in my,

164
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:59,939
one of my classes, uh, there
was one senior who came to

165
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:03,418
meet my professor again and
I was facing some issues.

166
00:08:03,418 --> 00:08:07,079
So he was like typing
right away on terminal.

167
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:12,403
And I was fascinated.
What he was actually doing, and

168
00:08:08,954 --> 00:08:13,923
he wasn't even looking anywhere.
Just tapping fast, fast, fast.

169
00:08:14,173 --> 00:08:18,014
And I, it really hit me like,
okay, this is something that

170
00:08:18,014 --> 00:08:23,774
I would also like to do.
And it is always something that

171
00:08:19,754 --> 00:08:27,553
every time you do something
different and new and it is

172
00:08:23,774 --> 00:08:31,754
challenging you at every point.
So I started, uh, I was

173
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:34,813
actually continuing my
engineering, but I was not

174
00:08:32,163 --> 00:08:36,313
sure at that point that what
would I actually be interested.

175
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:39,749
, so during interviews
and stuff, so I was also

176
00:08:39,749 --> 00:08:44,038
doing Java and all, but it
wasn't, uh, getting into me.

177
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,149
So at point, I, I thought maybe
I'd do something different.

178
00:08:48,719 --> 00:08:53,158
Uh, but then I, uh, went
into web development.

179
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:59,009
Uh, so started out with html,
fall in love with css, and, uh,

180
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:07,168
then JavaScript, uh, started a.
. Uh, previously I would, I was

181
00:09:03,149 --> 00:09:11,788
not mostly working in any kind
of, uh, like logical things or

182
00:09:07,168 --> 00:09:15,269
something, but uh, at Venice
Switch companies, when you get,

183
00:09:11,793 --> 00:09:18,719
uh, take home assignments, at
that point I really started

184
00:09:15,274 --> 00:09:20,948
getting into coding, like
real coding, not HTML and CSS.

185
00:09:21,418 --> 00:09:26,849
So that was the beginning,
and, and that is me falling

186
00:09:26,849 --> 00:09:28,109
in love with javascript.

187
00:09:28,403 --> 00:09:29,543
Bekah: That's awesome.
I love that.

188
00:09:29,543 --> 00:09:32,964
And so now you're doing a
little bit of React native.

189
00:09:32,994 --> 00:09:35,844
Will you talk a little bit about
like how you ended up there and

190
00:09:35,844 --> 00:09:38,693
the differences that you've seen
between React and React native?

191
00:09:39,989 --> 00:09:46,109
Aishwarya: Okay.
So React Native is, uh, I

192
00:09:40,168 --> 00:09:50,849
started in Hacktoberfest, I was
contributing to a React Native

193
00:09:46,109 --> 00:09:53,653
repository, uh, and then it was
just kind of, uh,  that much.

194
00:09:54,043 --> 00:09:57,374
But then, uh, recently
I've started, uh, working

195
00:09:57,374 --> 00:10:03,496
on it, uh, at work.
So the difference mainly is

196
00:09:59,144 --> 00:10:06,557
that, in React you use divs
and in React Native there

197
00:10:03,886 --> 00:10:10,006
are views kind of stuff.
Uh, and that main difference

198
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:14,326
being that, uh, you use
React for Web and, uh,

199
00:10:10,006 --> 00:10:15,407
react native for, uh, iOS
and Android, Android apps.

200
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:20,642
So mainly.
It is, uh, helpful because

201
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:24,302
of, if we, if you are using a
native language, it is mostly

202
00:10:20,642 --> 00:10:27,361
for a particular, uh, device.
So it is either for

203
00:10:24,302 --> 00:10:31,261
Iris or either Android.
But if you are using React

204
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:31,261
Native, it is for both of them.

205
00:10:32,621 --> 00:10:37,761
Dan: Yeah. Do you.
Having actual CSS  when

206
00:10:35,182 --> 00:10:40,251
you're working with React
Native, that's a, that's my

207
00:10:37,761 --> 00:10:42,772
biggest, that's always my
biggest, uh, struggle when

208
00:10:40,251 --> 00:10:45,471
I have React native projects
I'm working on is just like,

209
00:10:42,772 --> 00:10:48,711
this would be so easy if I
could just add a style, you

210
00:10:45,471 --> 00:10:51,081
know, to this or whatever.
Um, yeah. That's awesome.

211
00:10:51,596 --> 00:10:54,807
so you studied computer science
and you, did you say you were

212
00:10:54,807 --> 00:10:58,017
mostly doing Java during, during
your actual studies, or did

213
00:10:58,017 --> 00:11:01,636
you get into JavaScript stuff
while you were still in school?

214
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:04,601
Aishwarya: actually, Yeah,
actually, uh, web development

215
00:11:04,601 --> 00:11:09,701
was only a subject for one
semester, so it was mostly Java

216
00:11:09,942 --> 00:11:15,792
based things during college.
And, uh, I also did some

217
00:11:12,822 --> 00:11:17,322
python and stuff, but it
wasn't much back then.

218
00:11:18,057 --> 00:11:20,006
Dan: Yeah. Yeah.
No, that's, that's cool.

219
00:11:20,006 --> 00:11:23,756
So you got, uh, one, one class
of, of web stuff in and that

220
00:11:23,756 --> 00:11:29,568
kind got, got the bug going.
Yeah, I, I think that experience

221
00:11:25,437 --> 00:11:32,719
at, Is a shared one with a lot
of people where you, somebody

222
00:11:29,568 --> 00:11:35,298
gets into web development by,
you know, by doing h l and

223
00:11:32,778 --> 00:11:37,639
css and I, I, I think that
I would count that as real

224
00:11:35,448 --> 00:11:40,639
coding, you know, personally.
But it doesn't have

225
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:42,408
the, the logic puzzles. Right.
It doesn't have some

226
00:11:40,849 --> 00:11:46,668
of those pieces. Yeah.
And um, and I think that there's

227
00:11:42,798 --> 00:11:49,009
a lot of people that get into
front of development that way

228
00:11:46,668 --> 00:11:51,239
and then find their happy place.
You know, like doing this

229
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:55,428
stuff, doing react or, doing
react native, um, And including

230
00:11:51,288 --> 00:11:57,889
myself, , you know, because
you still get some of the,

231
00:11:55,428 --> 00:12:01,339
you still get some of the
instant, uh, and sorry, if you

232
00:11:57,948 --> 00:12:02,328
guys can hear my, my dog is
chewing on a bone behind me.

233
00:12:02,328 --> 00:12:06,438
So, uh, Ollie is here, uh,
in the podcast Studio  today.

234
00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:11,719
Um, but uh, what I was saying
was something about react.

235
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:14,538
Oh man, I was about
to make an amazing

236
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:18,589
Bekah: CML and the instant.

237
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,528
Dan: Instant gratification.
That's what it was. Yes. Okay.

238
00:12:21,619 --> 00:12:23,298
You get a lot of the front
end development, you can

239
00:12:23,298 --> 00:12:25,849
still get a lot of the sort of
instant gratification stuff.

240
00:12:25,849 --> 00:12:28,129
Right. And you get to like, see
and mess around with the

241
00:12:28,129 --> 00:12:29,839
thing that you're building,
which is one of my favorite

242
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:36,168
parts, um, about front end.
Um, but you still get to do

243
00:12:31,999 --> 00:12:37,729
some of the like, hard, you
know, harder logic stuff too.

244
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:43,999
Um, so, so yeah. That's cool.
I'm, I'm always happy when

245
00:12:40,278 --> 00:12:46,129
people kind of have, have
like found, you know, found

246
00:12:43,999 --> 00:12:47,568
something that they, they are
enjoying and, and succeeding in.

247
00:12:48,413 --> 00:12:48,774
It's.

248
00:12:49,908 --> 00:12:53,298
Bekah: And you mentioned doing
some React native work during

249
00:12:53,298 --> 00:12:56,778
Hacktoberfest, and so I wanna
transition into that topic,

250
00:12:57,109 --> 00:13:00,349
working through Hackfest
and Open Source this year.

251
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:02,308
Was this your first year
doing Hacktoberfest?

252
00:13:03,153 --> 00:13:04,594
Aishwarya: Yeah. Yeah, it was

253
00:13:05,389 --> 00:13:08,298
Bekah: And many pull
requests did you have at

254
00:13:08,298 --> 00:13:09,109
the end of this Hackfest?

255
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,458
Aishwarya: Actually it was nine,

256
00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:13,729
Bekah: Nine? Yeah.

257
00:13:13,778 --> 00:13:16,058
Aishwarya: to nine. I.

258
00:13:17,538 --> 00:13:19,068
Bekah: You just,
you just rocked it.

259
00:13:19,068 --> 00:13:23,028
You just kept going.
You got your four and

260
00:13:20,089 --> 00:13:25,099
that didn't matter.
It was all of all the

261
00:13:23,028 --> 00:13:28,068
things that you could do.
And I was super impressed

262
00:13:25,099 --> 00:13:30,528
by not only were you doing
this for the first time,

263
00:13:28,068 --> 00:13:31,788
but you just crushed it.
You blew it out of the water.

264
00:13:31,793 --> 00:13:35,568
So what was that like
for you getting started

265
00:13:35,568 --> 00:13:36,739
with Hacktoberfest?

266
00:13:37,999 --> 00:13:41,269
Aishwarya: actually, uh, when
I, uh, started, I think I was a

267
00:13:41,274 --> 00:13:44,928
day or two late maybe, and most
of the, uh, two weeks that I've

268
00:13:44,933 --> 00:13:49,698
seen were almost like, oh, my,
uh, two prs were a approved and

269
00:13:49,698 --> 00:13:54,938
accepted and all that stuff.
So, and going into, I was

270
00:13:51,469 --> 00:13:56,938
not sure if I had even do.
Two or more than two.

271
00:13:57,328 --> 00:14:00,958
So I went into like, okay,
I'll at least, uh, learn

272
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:04,349
something and maybe I'll
do it seriously next year.

273
00:14:04,739 --> 00:14:12,308
I got into it in that attitude.
But, uh, when I started actually

274
00:14:07,859 --> 00:14:15,298
doing it, I really loved it.
It was really great

275
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:18,958
experience for me.
Uh, got to improve my

276
00:14:15,749 --> 00:14:20,339
coding skills, got to
learn new technologies.

277
00:14:21,288 --> 00:14:25,609
And it was really very
interesting and also, uh,

278
00:14:26,359 --> 00:14:29,028
everyone is always saying
Open source, open source, but

279
00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:32,438
when you actually experience
this, it is very rewarding.

280
00:14:32,892 --> 00:14:36,912
Dan: Yeah, I agree.
And it's, and it's, it does

281
00:14:33,971 --> 00:14:39,221
take, and this is one, one
of the reasons why I love

282
00:14:36,912 --> 00:14:42,701
Hacktoberfest so much, and I
love like what we, what we do at

283
00:14:39,221 --> 00:14:44,501
Virtual Coffee, because it, it
is a different approach, right?

284
00:14:44,506 --> 00:14:46,511
I mean, it's, you know, it's
a little bit different than a

285
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:48,642
situation where you're in a job
and somebody tells you what to

286
00:14:48,642 --> 00:14:51,942
do or, or you're, uh, building
your own thing and you kind of

287
00:14:51,942 --> 00:14:55,152
have it all in your head, right?
Um, there's, there's

288
00:14:52,932 --> 00:14:55,751
some different steps,
I think, but once.

289
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,231
a lot of people have had
that experience here.

290
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:01,442
Once you get through the first
couple, you know, the first

291
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:04,591
couple poll requests, and, and,
and you feel that reward, you

292
00:15:04,591 --> 00:15:10,652
know, uh, hopefully  anyway.
Uh, you know, and not everybody

293
00:15:07,081 --> 00:15:12,841
has, uh, not everybody has
awesome experiences, but I

294
00:15:10,652 --> 00:15:15,511
think most of the time they are.
And, um, that's really, it

295
00:15:12,902 --> 00:15:17,881
is really great to hear.
And I, I wanna do, I just

296
00:15:15,511 --> 00:15:21,631
looked it up on our, on our
roundup, but, uh, we have

297
00:15:17,881 --> 00:15:22,861
you at 10 pull requests for
Hacktoberfest, not nine.

298
00:15:24,511 --> 00:15:27,331
you know, you're shorten
yourself one, so made it to 10.

299
00:15:27,871 --> 00:15:30,032
Oh, you were top our, top
our leaderboard for, uh,

300
00:15:30,152 --> 00:15:32,642
for total pull requests.
So that's pretty awesome.

301
00:15:33,106 --> 00:15:38,427
Bekah: Awesome.
So when you decided to get

302
00:15:33,927 --> 00:15:41,547
into Hacktoberfest, what were
your thoughts on open source

303
00:15:38,427 --> 00:15:41,547
contributions in general?

304
00:15:42,054 --> 00:15:46,404
Aishwarya: So actually, uh,
before, uh, Hacktoberfest I

305
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:50,365
actually, uh, might have Googled
something, but I was not sure,

306
00:15:51,024 --> 00:15:53,934
uh, about the repositories
or where to contribute.

307
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:58,899
I was not confident enough to
do actually, uh, ask someone

308
00:15:58,899 --> 00:16:04,909
if I could work on this.
But, uh, then afterwards it

309
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:04,909
sort of just fell through.

310
00:16:05,225 --> 00:16:06,754
Bekah: Yeah, so that
can be a really.

311
00:16:07,294 --> 00:16:10,325
And tricky thing for first time
contributors, making sure that

312
00:16:10,325 --> 00:16:13,985
everybody feels supported and
and finding that first issue.

313
00:16:14,044 --> 00:16:17,315
And it seems like that
was a challenge that

314
00:16:17,315 --> 00:16:21,544
you found as well.
Even registering a couple

315
00:16:18,485 --> 00:16:25,554
days later, whatever happened
with that, everything

316
00:16:21,549 --> 00:16:29,674
gets picked up so quickly.
So do you have advice for

317
00:16:25,835 --> 00:16:32,674
anybody that is considering
getting started in open source

318
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:32,674
on what to do in that situ.

319
00:16:33,544 --> 00:16:36,274
Aishwarya: so my main advice
would be that, uh, you

320
00:16:36,274 --> 00:16:39,904
should find the good first
issues or break beginner

321
00:16:39,904 --> 00:16:44,134
friendly issues using that
tag in GitHub in my case.

322
00:16:46,269 --> 00:16:50,825
and you should at least try even.
Uh, first contribution

323
00:16:48,605 --> 00:16:52,625
should not always be
a coding contribution.

324
00:16:52,629 --> 00:16:55,804
It can also be like a
document you contributing to

325
00:16:55,809 --> 00:17:00,154
a documentation, any typos,
fixing, anything like that.

326
00:17:00,215 --> 00:17:04,805
So first contribution
is like, you should at

327
00:17:04,805 --> 00:17:06,815
least try and see how it.

328
00:17:07,505 --> 00:17:11,194
Dan: Yeah, I love that.
I, I, and I think that like,

329
00:17:08,365 --> 00:17:13,984
that's something that we, we try
to push as well and it's really

330
00:17:11,194 --> 00:17:18,454
good advice is it's find you
can find, uh, pull or you can

331
00:17:13,984 --> 00:17:20,075
find issues that aren't code and
that can help you get started.

332
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:24,289
Um, and.
I've, I'm sure I've said this

333
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:27,529
on the podcast before, but, you
know, learning too many things

334
00:17:24,289 --> 00:17:30,440
at once, uh, lots of times
results in you, in, you know,

335
00:17:27,529 --> 00:17:35,119
getting frustrated or whatever.
And so if you are trying

336
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:36,619
to learn open source stuff,
then then concentrating on

337
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:38,509
something that you don't
have to like learn some,

338
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:40,640
a whole other thing to do.
The issue is great advice.

339
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:42,200
Uh, I think that's,
I think that's,

340
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:47,082
Bekah: Yeah, and I, there
are more companies out there,

341
00:17:47,082 --> 00:17:50,501
open source companies that are
creating those issues as well.

342
00:17:50,741 --> 00:17:53,201
I think it was AppRight
who was one of this year's

343
00:17:53,201 --> 00:17:56,741
sponsors, had issues open
for people who wanted to

344
00:17:56,741 --> 00:18:02,166
write blog posts, so maybe.
You are not up to taking

345
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:03,126
on an issue, but you
can write about that.

346
00:18:03,126 --> 00:18:05,557
And writing about that
helps other users to

347
00:18:05,557 --> 00:18:08,136
understand, these are the
ways that we can use this.

348
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,356
Oh, this is how you
implement that feature.

349
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:13,957
And I think that's a really
interesting take on getting

350
00:18:13,957 --> 00:18:17,076
more people involved in
open source contributions.

351
00:18:17,317 --> 00:18:22,626
But I think for me, that's
something that seems.

352
00:18:23,027 --> 00:18:26,567
Like a good path to be able
to get into a project and kind

353
00:18:26,567 --> 00:18:30,047
of evaluate the project too.
I'm a little bit more

354
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:33,436
confident writing than I
am with coding, and I can

355
00:18:30,047 --> 00:18:36,737
see what those interactions
with the open source

356
00:18:33,436 --> 00:18:38,717
teams are like while doing
something that I'm a little

357
00:18:36,737 --> 00:18:45,751
bit more comfortable with.
You know, one of the things

358
00:18:42,771 --> 00:18:49,741
that I think is impressive about
what you did in Octoberfest as

359
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:54,511
well was you had been working
in React, but then you still

360
00:18:49,741 --> 00:19:01,051
took a React native issue.
So what got you thinking that

361
00:18:54,632 --> 00:19:04,021
it would be okay to take on an
issue working with a technology

362
00:19:01,051 --> 00:19:04,021
that you hadn't used before?

363
00:19:04,481 --> 00:19:10,102
Aishwarya: Uh, so the main.
main point was that I was

364
00:19:06,981 --> 00:19:14,092
familiar, uh, with the
maintainer and it, uh,

365
00:19:10,561 --> 00:19:18,172
communication was really
great and, uh, I knew if,

366
00:19:14,092 --> 00:19:22,432
and, uh, while reading the
issue, I was confident enough

367
00:19:18,172 --> 00:19:25,971
that I actually, it was a
big thing for me, uh, to even

368
00:19:22,432 --> 00:19:27,622
write that message that if,
can I work on this issue?

369
00:19:28,071 --> 00:19:32,422
But, uh, when after
communicating and, uh,

370
00:19:32,511 --> 00:19:38,662
after, uh, The, uh, the steps
were very clear of what I

371
00:19:38,662 --> 00:19:44,362
wanted, what I had to do.
So it was really helpful

372
00:19:40,942 --> 00:19:47,001
in that point of point.
And uh, so that helped me a lot.

373
00:19:47,384 --> 00:19:52,005
Bekah: Yeah, I like that.
Knowing the maintainer can

374
00:19:48,734 --> 00:19:53,265
make it, again, decrease
those barriers to entry.

375
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:57,444
And so reaching out to a
maintainer, Um, whether you know

376
00:19:57,444 --> 00:20:01,884
them from Twitter or in Slack
or if you can add something to

377
00:20:01,884 --> 00:20:04,974
the discussion, it never hurts
to start that conversation

378
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:08,904
with them and see what the
expectations are as well.

379
00:20:08,904 --> 00:20:13,434
So most of my open source
projects are there to help

380
00:20:13,434 --> 00:20:17,815
people get started in open
source and to encourage that.

381
00:20:17,815 --> 00:20:20,904
So I think, actually think
in my postpartum wellness

382
00:20:20,904 --> 00:20:23,484
app, the majority of people
who have contributed.

383
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:26,625
Have not used React
native before.

384
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,130
Aishwarya: Yeah.

385
00:20:27,464 --> 00:20:32,595
Bekah: And so, uh, the not
every open source project

386
00:20:32,805 --> 00:20:40,755
is created to be okay.
Now my brain stopped.

387
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:45,329
Um, not every open source
project is created with

388
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:47,609
the same mission in mind.
Uh, that's what I was gonna say.

389
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:51,150
And so, you know, there's
different ways to evaluate open

390
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:54,839
source repositories as well.
And one of those

391
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:56,309
ways is what does the
communication look like?

392
00:20:56,309 --> 00:20:58,920
What are the expectations
of the maintainers?

393
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,259
And sometimes you can
get that from the issues.

394
00:21:01,265 --> 00:21:04,970
And I, you know, I talked about
this before about one of the

395
00:21:04,974 --> 00:21:09,450
things I learned a couple of
years,  was writing issues can

396
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:13,200
be really hard if you wanna
write a good issue or time

397
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,990
consuming really, because you
wanna help people understand.

398
00:21:16,994 --> 00:21:20,085
What you want.
Part of the problem is

399
00:21:18,075 --> 00:21:21,105
a lot of times I don't
understand what I want.

400
00:21:21,404 --> 00:21:25,634
Um,  requires me to make some
decisions, but if you can

401
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:30,525
look at an issue and, and
understand, or if you feel

402
00:21:30,529 --> 00:21:34,214
like the maintainer would be
open to answering questions,

403
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:37,305
then that can be a really great
way to form that relationship

404
00:21:37,305 --> 00:21:42,464
and to work on something new.
And uh, just one last

405
00:21:39,734 --> 00:21:47,535
thing in that tangent.
Open source is a really great

406
00:21:43,664 --> 00:21:50,595
space to be able to use.
Its new technology that you

407
00:21:47,535 --> 00:21:55,125
might not have the opportunity
to use otherwise and see like,

408
00:21:50,595 --> 00:21:58,035
Hey, maybe, maybe you hated
React Native and you thought,

409
00:21:55,125 --> 00:22:01,845
I never wanna touch this again.
Right. Um, I don't, I don't think

410
00:21:58,815 --> 00:22:04,634
that happened because now
you're working on React

411
00:22:01,845 --> 00:22:09,394
native stuff at work.
But I think that having

412
00:22:04,634 --> 00:22:12,134
those experiences helps
you to learn and to grow

413
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:22,815
in a, a different way.
So when you, so you went through

414
00:22:18,434 --> 00:22:26,444
this whole open source journey
and in the beginning you weren't

415
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:27,704
really sure of what to expect
or what things would look like.

416
00:22:28,154 --> 00:22:31,634
How did your perspective
change or did it change at

417
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:35,265
the end of Hacktoberfest when
you completed your 10 prs?

418
00:22:35,734 --> 00:22:38,525
Aishwarya: actually my, uh,
perspective changed when I

419
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:42,605
completed four and I, uh,
was really interested in com,

420
00:22:42,634 --> 00:22:50,126
uh, doing more open source.
Change in perspective was that

421
00:22:45,537 --> 00:22:55,106
I got more, a bit more confident
in uh, com, uh, asking for,

422
00:22:50,156 --> 00:22:56,366
uh, asking two maintainers if
I could work on this issue.

423
00:22:56,757 --> 00:23:00,207
Also, I was a bit more
confident in my skills as well

424
00:23:00,207 --> 00:23:01,676
there at that point of time.

425
00:23:02,035 --> 00:23:06,234
Bekah: Yeah. That's great.
And so you were a first

426
00:23:02,755 --> 00:23:10,724
time contributor, but how
long have you been coding

427
00:23:06,265 --> 00:23:10,724
before this Hacktoberfest?

428
00:23:11,317 --> 00:23:14,047
Aishwarya: I'd say, uh,
this march is going to

429
00:23:14,047 --> 00:23:16,777
be a three years for me
working in this industry.

430
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:19,866
But in, uh, initial days
I was only working with

431
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:23,616
html, css, and, uh, did a
little bit of WordPress.

432
00:23:23,616 --> 00:23:26,467
So means our script is
mostly like two years.

433
00:23:27,152 --> 00:23:29,761
Bekah: I think that's important
to point out because we

434
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:33,301
have had a lot of different
contributors who have varying

435
00:23:33,307 --> 00:23:37,832
degrees of experience, right?
And a lot of times people

436
00:23:34,741 --> 00:23:40,531
think that first time
contributors are people who

437
00:23:37,832 --> 00:23:41,942
are very new to coding, and
that's just not the case.

438
00:23:41,946 --> 00:23:43,471
You know, there are
people out there that.

439
00:23:43,557 --> 00:23:47,696
Are interested or maybe
are aware of open source,

440
00:23:47,696 --> 00:23:53,007
but haven't contributed.
And so like finding those

441
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:57,176
different levels of providing
issues and support for people

442
00:23:53,007 --> 00:24:00,507
is, I, I think, uh, it's really
important to think about like

443
00:23:57,176 --> 00:24:05,487
their developers at all stages
of their careers who are willing

444
00:24:00,511 --> 00:24:07,856
to contribute if they feel
supported in the way that they

445
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:10,817
need supported to do that thing.
So I think that it's, it's great

446
00:24:07,856 --> 00:24:10,817
that you jumped in this year.

447
00:24:11,148 --> 00:24:14,509
Aishwarya: Yeah, actually, uh,
I had a very great support with

448
00:24:14,509 --> 00:24:18,499
you guys as well because, uh,
in the Hacktoberfest channel,

449
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:23,509
so we used to get a lot of good
first issues and, uh, because of

450
00:24:23,509 --> 00:24:28,493
that, Also, I did not have to go
out of the way to find issues.

451
00:24:28,854 --> 00:24:32,394
Uh, most of the time I
would get it there as well.

452
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:39,503
And supportive.
Uh, maintainer is also a great

453
00:24:34,614 --> 00:24:43,523
point in this because, uh,
if I'm able to communicate

454
00:24:39,534 --> 00:24:47,003
with, I know that, so the
person in front of me is

455
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:48,594
going to explain what the
problem is, then it helps.

456
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:52,049
Bekah: Yeah, I love that.
And finding that community

457
00:24:50,069 --> 00:24:54,569
of people that are
willing to support you

458
00:24:52,049 --> 00:24:57,720
can be really important.
And I know, you know, one

459
00:24:54,599 --> 00:25:01,140
of, one of the things that I
saw at Virtual Coffee that I

460
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:03,599
really appreciated is there
were a lot of maintainers out

461
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:06,150
there who were willing to.
Add issues for people

462
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:09,059
of varying levels.
And so, like you were saying,

463
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:13,680
uh, in those first couple
of days, those, uh, beginner

464
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:15,809
issues or good first issues
are really snatched up quickly.

465
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,289
so if people wanna join
in later, it can be really

466
00:25:19,289 --> 00:25:22,349
hard to find something.
So it, it was nice to see.

467
00:25:22,894 --> 00:25:24,994
People asking like,
Hey, I'm looking for a

468
00:25:24,994 --> 00:25:28,414
good first time issue.
And people saying like, Hey,

469
00:25:26,164 --> 00:25:31,414
I'll write something up,
or I have this issue, and

470
00:25:28,414 --> 00:25:34,355
then that way you know that
you have the support of the

471
00:25:31,414 --> 00:25:36,634
maintainer and you know that
there's a possibility for more

472
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:41,317
interaction there as well.
So if somebody is thinking

473
00:25:37,597 --> 00:25:44,919
about getting into open
source now, outside of

474
00:25:41,317 --> 00:25:49,147
Hacktoberfest, what do you
think other than looking at

475
00:25:44,923 --> 00:25:51,258
good first issues, how do you.
I think they should get started.

476
00:25:51,684 --> 00:25:55,255
Aishwarya: So what I've been
doing is, uh, recently, uh,

477
00:25:55,285 --> 00:25:59,545
I've been searching on YouTube
videos as well, uh, when most

478
00:25:59,545 --> 00:26:02,943
of the people, Explain in
their videos, which, which

479
00:26:02,943 --> 00:26:07,101
are the, organizations that
help, uh, begin, that have,

480
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,790
uh, beginner friendly issues
to, for you to work on?

481
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:14,570
So I've been doing that
actually, and mostly Google.

482
00:26:14,871 --> 00:26:19,167
But in case of Google, sometimes
what happens is that few of

483
00:26:19,167 --> 00:26:27,343
the links are broken or old.
or also, uh, if it is not

484
00:26:22,542 --> 00:26:32,383
October 1st, I've seen that, uh,
mostly everyone is not available

485
00:26:27,373 --> 00:26:34,063
to reply to, uh, your message
if you are asking for an issue.

486
00:26:34,063 --> 00:26:39,232
So maybe, uh, just waiting
it out is what you'll have

487
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:40,952
to do at this point of time.
Think.

488
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:44,260
Dan: I think that's really.
I mean, I think all

489
00:26:42,721 --> 00:26:47,500
that was good advice.
Your last point is, is an

490
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:50,510
important one I think, for
people to remember because, if

491
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:54,471
you're gonna be a contributor to
a repository, lots of times it's

492
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:57,290
because you, you know, maybe you
found it like, like, like you're

493
00:26:54,471 --> 00:27:00,320
doing with Google or, or YouTube
or, or maybe it's a package that

494
00:26:57,290 --> 00:27:02,000
you use or something like that.
Um, and you would like

495
00:27:00,351 --> 00:27:04,330
to see an improvement.
but what'll happen is you

496
00:27:02,351 --> 00:27:09,040
get all excited, right?
And you know, and maybe

497
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:10,961
comment on the issue or
maybe try to work up a

498
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:13,510
poll request or whatever.
Um, and all of that stuff

499
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:14,800
is in your brain, right?
Because you're working

500
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:17,770
on it right then.
But maintainers are, especially

501
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:21,701
with smaller packages or
smaller projects, um, aren't,

502
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:22,901
you know, in there every
day doing stuff every day.

503
00:27:22,901 --> 00:27:25,181
And so there's like this
whole context which thing

504
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,540
that needs to happen.
And, and so, um, I really

505
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:31,060
appreciated how you said having
some patience, you know, and

506
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:34,421
like building that into your
mindset because, um, because

507
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:35,681
it's important and you know,
everybody's doing their best.

508
00:27:36,445 --> 00:27:38,756
I re just, just recently
had a poll request.

509
00:27:38,826 --> 00:27:43,226
I, I made an issue. What was it?
No, I saw, I had,

510
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:45,986
I had a problem.
I ran into a problem, found

511
00:27:43,226 --> 00:27:48,625
that there was somebody else
had, had the problem and wrote

512
00:27:45,986 --> 00:27:50,756
the issue and I was able to
like, make a poll request

513
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:53,576
to fix it, you know, so I
made this poll request and

514
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:55,556
commented and all this stuff,
and then just didn't hear

515
00:27:53,665 --> 00:27:58,165
anything for like two weeks.
And then after two weeks it

516
00:27:55,976 --> 00:28:00,625
was just like, got merged.
, Nope, no comments,

517
00:27:58,855 --> 00:28:02,836
no, like, nothing.
And, you know, and like,

518
00:28:00,625 --> 00:28:03,715
I'm like, honestly,
that's cool, you know?

519
00:28:03,721 --> 00:28:06,846
Uh, like, the urge to go
back and say, oh yeah,

520
00:28:06,905 --> 00:28:09,786
did you miss this email?
Or, you know, please, you

521
00:28:07,776 --> 00:28:11,435
know, check back,  all that
stuff is understandable.

522
00:28:11,766 --> 00:28:15,605
But, um, but I, you know,
everybody kind of, everybody's

523
00:28:15,605 --> 00:28:18,665
busy and all of that stuff,
so, um, I think that's, I

524
00:28:18,665 --> 00:28:21,605
think that's a really good
plan of, you know, making the,

525
00:28:21,635 --> 00:28:23,915
making the effort, but like
also trying to, trying to,

526
00:28:24,066 --> 00:28:26,556
you know, use some patience
and understand that people.

527
00:28:27,276 --> 00:28:29,736
Just constantly watching their,
their get help notifications,

528
00:28:29,736 --> 00:28:30,655
you know, day and night

529
00:28:32,263 --> 00:28:34,874
Bekah: I like that tip too, of
checking on YouTube and seeing

530
00:28:34,874 --> 00:28:39,913
where people are pointing you.
I have never thought about

531
00:28:36,703 --> 00:28:41,804
that or heard anybody else
give that advice, and I

532
00:28:39,913 --> 00:28:48,328
think that's really unique.
So I do appreciate that and I,

533
00:28:41,804 --> 00:28:49,618
I would say, Along with all of
the great tips that you gave.

534
00:28:49,618 --> 00:28:51,989
Sometimes just putting it
out there into the world.

535
00:28:52,199 --> 00:28:53,759
I'm looking for a
good first issue.

536
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:57,479
Does anyone have one?
Somebody might respond

537
00:28:55,808 --> 00:29:01,828
to that, you know?
Um, because it, like the

538
00:28:57,689 --> 00:29:05,939
searchability is often not
great for these things, uh,

539
00:29:01,979 --> 00:29:09,759
for a lot of the reasons that
you said, you know, sometimes

540
00:29:05,939 --> 00:29:12,989
projects, Kind of die after
octoberfest, or they're no

541
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:15,368
longer being maintained.
And so you try and take

542
00:29:13,028 --> 00:29:17,828
something on and nothing
happens, and then that

543
00:29:15,368 --> 00:29:20,078
can be frustrating.
And we definitely don't

544
00:29:17,828 --> 00:29:21,098
want people to be frustrated
with that experience.

545
00:29:21,104 --> 00:29:24,338
So, so looking and seeing
what the activity level is

546
00:29:24,338 --> 00:29:29,669
like is I think, um, really
important as you, uh, navigate

547
00:29:29,673 --> 00:29:30,989
into open source contribu.

548
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:34,692
Dan: I, uh, actually was
I, I had wanted to call

549
00:29:34,692 --> 00:29:36,832
it that YouTube, your
YouTube tip as well.

550
00:29:36,882 --> 00:29:40,612
Um, I was wondering if you.
It's okay if you don't know

551
00:29:39,201 --> 00:29:42,682
them off the top of your
head, but if you could share

552
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:45,231
some of your, some of their
creators, excuse me, some of

553
00:29:42,682 --> 00:29:47,842
the creators that are doing
those videos, um, the, like

554
00:29:45,231 --> 00:29:50,301
that you were talking about.
Uh, I would, you know, and

555
00:29:48,172 --> 00:29:52,102
you can send them to me after
if you don't remember, uh,

556
00:29:50,301 --> 00:29:54,051
like off the top of your head.
But I'd love to like

557
00:29:52,102 --> 00:29:56,932
check some of them out.
Maybe we can link a couple

558
00:29:54,082 --> 00:29:59,031
in the, um, in the show
notes, because that seemed

559
00:29:56,932 --> 00:30:01,041
like a really good idea.
And I also had never, I

560
00:29:59,031 --> 00:30:03,727
hadn't heard of that and
I, I think it's great. So, Yeah.

561
00:30:03,817 --> 00:30:06,636
Uh, I don't know if you know
it or remember off the top

562
00:30:06,636 --> 00:30:08,797
of your head, but if you do,

563
00:30:08,842 --> 00:30:10,342
Aishwarya: Actually, I
don't remember them, but

564
00:30:10,342 --> 00:30:11,481
I'll share the links with

565
00:30:11,826 --> 00:30:13,416
Dan: Yeah. Yeah.
I, I would love that.

566
00:30:13,416 --> 00:30:14,767
And we'll, we'll make sure
to put 'em on the show notes

567
00:30:14,767 --> 00:30:16,807
because I, that sounded like
a really cool and interesting

568
00:30:16,807 --> 00:30:19,987
idea and, and a unique idea and
maybe something we could get

569
00:30:19,987 --> 00:30:23,007
into at Virtual Coffee as well.
So , we'll see.

570
00:30:23,395 --> 00:30:26,330
Bekah: what do you think some
of the biggest challenges you

571
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:31,451
faced during your open source
contributions have been?

572
00:30:31,811 --> 00:30:36,281
Aishwarya: main is, uh, finding
a good first issue and that

573
00:30:36,281 --> 00:30:40,511
not being more than two people
who are already asking for that

574
00:30:40,511 --> 00:30:44,442
same issue, but I don't think
I have faced it that much.

575
00:30:44,951 --> 00:30:48,882
And also, What I'm faced
mean was, uh, the merge

576
00:30:49,342 --> 00:30:52,291
conflicts, when you're,
uh, merging a branch or,

577
00:30:52,647 --> 00:30:54,928
uh, when you're creating
a pull request, actually.

578
00:30:55,317 --> 00:30:58,438
So that was something that I
found a bit difficult because,

579
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:03,097
uh, I, I've been previously
working with, uh, Azure DevOps.

580
00:31:03,583 --> 00:31:08,323
So it was, uh, there, there
I used, uh, . So it wasn't

581
00:31:08,323 --> 00:31:14,593
like much of a terminal use.
So the, this also much conflict

582
00:31:10,603 --> 00:31:17,893
was something that I found
a bit difficult, but once

583
00:31:14,597 --> 00:31:19,722
figured it out, it was also a
bit, uh, easier to understand.

584
00:31:20,164 --> 00:31:22,184
Dan: So wait, what
was your solution?

585
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:24,125
Did you end up using some
command line things, or

586
00:31:24,125 --> 00:31:27,704
did you use different, did
the GitHub UI or you know,

587
00:31:28,384 --> 00:31:31,144
Aishwarya: No, no.
I ended up using,

588
00:31:28,805 --> 00:31:35,365
uh, terminal only.
That also was the main, uh,

589
00:31:31,144 --> 00:31:35,924
it got me working on terminal.
He.

590
00:31:37,075 --> 00:31:37,734
Dan: that. I love

591
00:31:37,815 --> 00:31:43,640
Bekah: merge conflicts.
I, I have been known to like

592
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:43,640
delete repos and start over.

593
00:31:45,115 --> 00:31:48,444
Dan: I, uh, no, I
mean, it is, it's a.

594
00:31:49,164 --> 00:31:53,065
They're, they can be
hairy and not fun. Um, for sure.

595
00:31:53,125 --> 00:31:55,585
Uh, but I love the idea
of like, I, I love your

596
00:31:55,585 --> 00:31:58,615
approach anyway, of taking
it as an opportunity, right.

597
00:31:58,619 --> 00:32:00,414
To, to learn something
new and, and get better at

598
00:32:00,414 --> 00:32:03,384
something that you wanted to,
like you're, uh, the senior,

599
00:32:03,835 --> 00:32:06,505
um, in school who was typing
really fast in the terminal.

600
00:32:06,565 --> 00:32:09,714
You know, . That's right.
You're, you're just about there.

601
00:32:09,714 --> 00:32:16,196
That's that's really.
So, do you have any, I I might

602
00:32:11,247 --> 00:32:18,817
have checked out your GitHub,
you know, profile just recently,

603
00:32:16,257 --> 00:32:21,356
but I, I saw you're working
on a personal project, which

604
00:32:19,047 --> 00:32:24,717
looks, looks kind of cool.
Uh, is that like

605
00:32:21,686 --> 00:32:27,567
an Instagram app?
Is that like, that's just

606
00:32:25,227 --> 00:32:27,567
like a personal hobby project.

607
00:32:29,096 --> 00:32:31,886
Aishwarya: Uh, yeah, actually
I want to explore more

608
00:32:31,886 --> 00:32:35,446
reactive, so I've started
working on that a little.

609
00:32:36,207 --> 00:32:38,457
Dan: Yeah. That's awesome.
So is it like something you

610
00:32:36,781 --> 00:32:39,896
just kind of came up with
in your head, uh, like that?

611
00:32:39,896 --> 00:32:41,967
Or is it like you're following
a tutorial or, you know,

612
00:32:42,567 --> 00:32:44,396
Aishwarya: Uh, no, actually
I found a tutorial.

613
00:32:44,576 --> 00:32:49,527
So, uh, they make, so I
tried first myself, then

614
00:32:49,527 --> 00:32:53,396
see what they are doing.
So I also kind of get

615
00:32:50,606 --> 00:32:55,767
to know different,
uh, coding, uh, types.

616
00:32:55,826 --> 00:32:59,096
So doing something with my
style, but doing, uh, the

617
00:32:59,096 --> 00:33:03,057
person that YouTuber is
doing his style, so combining

618
00:33:03,207 --> 00:33:04,616
and so I'm going that.

619
00:33:05,265 --> 00:33:08,654
Dan: That is, that's really cool.
I, I, I love, like,

620
00:33:06,825 --> 00:33:12,210
I love seeing.
people's like work.

621
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,339
I, I've seen people work on
projects like that, you know,

622
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,289
and, and, but that's one of my
favorite things about GitHub

623
00:33:16,289 --> 00:33:18,180
is, is being able to see like,
what are, what are people like

624
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:20,755
noodling with, you know, what,
what are people kind of doing?

625
00:33:20,755 --> 00:33:22,674
And you can kind of see
everybody's like project shelf,

626
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:25,974
you know, like in my garage I
have this just shelf of stuff

627
00:33:26,035 --> 00:33:28,974
that maybe I'm half done.
Maybe, you know, I, maybe I used

628
00:33:26,994 --> 00:33:32,065
it to like do something else,
or, or maybe I meant to finish

629
00:33:28,974 --> 00:33:34,224
it and maybe it's just something
I'm currently working on, but

630
00:33:32,065 --> 00:33:36,683
it's like all there, you know?
Um, and I like that about GitHub.

631
00:33:36,683 --> 00:33:39,233
I like that people kind
of by default put things

632
00:33:39,233 --> 00:33:42,114
in public, you know?
Um, like this, you know,

633
00:33:40,253 --> 00:33:44,019
and it doesn't have to,
like, it's not ever, it's

634
00:33:42,114 --> 00:33:48,294
just for you, you know?
It's not like a, I don't

635
00:33:44,153 --> 00:33:49,884
know, other thing, , whatever,
you know, it is not like a

636
00:33:48,294 --> 00:33:51,653
thing that you're looking
for contributions on for,

637
00:33:49,884 --> 00:33:53,423
for example, you know,
but you still, it's, it's

638
00:33:51,659 --> 00:33:55,074
still, it's like public and
it's, and it's out there

639
00:33:53,423 --> 00:33:56,284
and I think that's great.
I think that's very cool.

640
00:33:57,398 --> 00:34:01,838
Bekah: Yeah.
One of the things that I've

641
00:33:57,548 --> 00:34:06,159
liked about GitHub recently is
the feed that you get on your

642
00:34:01,868 --> 00:34:09,489
main page, I guess, because if
you are following people, you

643
00:34:06,163 --> 00:34:11,949
see the projects that they're
working on or the projects

644
00:34:09,489 --> 00:34:16,088
that they've starred, and
that's been another way that

645
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:19,134
I've seen people find new.
Open issues just by kind

646
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:21,293
of browsing through,
like, oh, that person

647
00:34:19,134 --> 00:34:23,153
just started this project.
Let me go check that out

648
00:34:21,293 --> 00:34:25,224
and see what that's about.
Like, oh, there's an

649
00:34:23,153 --> 00:34:28,074
issue that I can take on.
And so sometimes you'll

650
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:31,974
accidentally fall into
that thing or you learn

651
00:34:28,074 --> 00:34:35,514
something new through that.
I guess it, it's a, a feed of

652
00:34:32,273 --> 00:34:36,954
the people that you follow.
I, um, I don't know.

653
00:34:36,954 --> 00:34:39,534
I just think that that feature
has been really, really

654
00:34:39,534 --> 00:34:42,666
fun to check out lately.
What are some, Ugh,

655
00:34:42,851 --> 00:34:45,521
Dan: Sorry, . I was
just gonna say agreed.

656
00:34:45,581 --> 00:34:48,942
Uh, I, I never remember to look
there cuz I just like have.

657
00:34:49,586 --> 00:34:51,507
Potter's bookmark, but
every time I go back to

658
00:34:51,507 --> 00:34:53,817
the GitHub homepage I'm
like, whoa, this is neat.

659
00:34:54,146 --> 00:34:56,996
There's so much stuff here, and
then I forget about it again.

660
00:34:57,237 --> 00:34:58,586
But I think that's good advice.

661
00:35:01,257 --> 00:35:03,567
Bekah: Are there projects
that you are interested

662
00:35:03,567 --> 00:35:06,447
in contributing to that
you've been checking out? Ashia.

663
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:10,139
Aishwarya: yeah, actually,
uh, some projects that I've

664
00:35:10,139 --> 00:35:15,929
been working on, uh, during,
uh, , I'm trying to see if

665
00:35:15,929 --> 00:35:20,655
there are any open issues.
Actually, I'm not, I'm

666
00:35:18,284 --> 00:35:24,585
not following anyone.
Or I was just, it was like

667
00:35:20,715 --> 00:35:29,385
a resume for me back then.
Uh, but nowadays I'm trying

668
00:35:24,735 --> 00:35:30,525
to see star, all the starring
and following each other.

669
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:34,394
And now that you've said,
uh, looking into all at

670
00:35:34,394 --> 00:35:37,045
the field, I think that
will also, we are not next.

671
00:35:37,521 --> 00:35:40,240
Dan: Yeah, I'm, I'm really bad
at, at doing, interacting with

672
00:35:40,246 --> 00:35:43,360
the social stuff on GitHub too,
like the stars, you know, I,

673
00:35:44,081 --> 00:35:46,210
I'm sure I have some star repos,
but I think at the beginning I

674
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:49,210
was using them as like, I don't
know, some sort of bookmark

675
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:52,181
thing or whatever, and you know,
like I wasn't really using it.

676
00:35:52,661 --> 00:35:54,701
How, how, how people
use it now, you know?

677
00:35:54,791 --> 00:35:57,164
And I just kind of stopped.
and same with following.

678
00:35:57,193 --> 00:35:59,563
I don't think I, well,
probably I follow a couple

679
00:35:59,563 --> 00:36:01,333
people just cause I wanted
to see how it worked, but

680
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:03,463
like, I, I just always
forget about it, you know?

681
00:36:03,463 --> 00:36:05,324
I don't, I don't know, I don't
think about it, but like, I,

682
00:36:05,324 --> 00:36:07,423
there's so much, there's so
much cool stuff that Gub is

683
00:36:07,423 --> 00:36:11,621
doing, um, to, and I, I think
a lot of it is to, do what

684
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:15,880
we're talking about, right?
Is to like expose other things

685
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:17,710
that other people are working on
to encourage, you know, people.

686
00:36:18,536 --> 00:36:20,246
To jump over and, you
know, help out and stuff.

687
00:36:20,556 --> 00:36:22,916
It is really cool.
So that's gonna be my mission.

688
00:36:22,916 --> 00:36:25,226
I'm gonna, I'm gonna start
starring and following people

689
00:36:25,226 --> 00:36:26,786
on GitHub more often, uh,

690
00:36:27,365 --> 00:36:29,356
Aishwarya: Yeah me too now

691
00:36:29,726 --> 00:36:31,556
Bekah: yeah, I think some of
the cool ones that I've seen

692
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:34,135
lately, so I've been messing
around with ChatGPT a lot.

693
00:36:34,135 --> 00:36:36,715
We've been talking a lot
about that at Virtual Coffee.

694
00:36:37,016 --> 00:36:39,565
Um, there have been a lot
of people who have put up

695
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:43,496
repositories that have like
good commands, good, uh, topics.

696
00:36:43,561 --> 00:36:46,561
To look up different ways
to approach it, resources

697
00:36:46,561 --> 00:36:50,251
for that, companies that are
using it or AI in some way.

698
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:54,601
And it's kind of been fun
to use it as a resource, uh,

699
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:57,661
rather than thinking of a
traditional open source project.

700
00:36:57,871 --> 00:37:00,181
It's just a markdown
repository of things.

701
00:37:00,186 --> 00:37:03,690
And so to be able to
learn in that way too,

702
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:11,641
I think is really nice.
I wish that there was

703
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:13,170
some way to sort, maybe a
little bit better in terms.

704
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:16,451
Like there's a lot of great,
really great resources that

705
00:37:16,451 --> 00:37:20,110
are listed there on GitHub,
and then there's a lot of

706
00:37:20,291 --> 00:37:28,420
like great code repositories.
It would be nice to

707
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:29,621
have a tag, this is just
me talking out loud. Sorry.

708
00:37:29,626 --> 00:37:32,650
I, this is something that
I would like to  to be

709
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:35,951
able to see how many people
have resources that are up.

710
00:37:35,951 --> 00:37:37,751
And that was one of my,
actually, I think that's

711
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:40,150
my very first open source
project that I ever.

712
00:37:41,065 --> 00:37:46,436
Was, I was part of a moms and
tech group, and so I created a

713
00:37:46,436 --> 00:37:51,445
markdown repository of resources
and organizations that supported

714
00:37:51,445 --> 00:37:56,096
moms in their tech journey,
and that was, I don't know,

715
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:58,615
that was fun because I got to
meet a lot of new people and

716
00:37:58,615 --> 00:38:01,885
kind of talk through some of
those issues and I, I really

717
00:38:01,885 --> 00:38:07,931
enjoy the conversation part.
being an open source maintainer,

718
00:38:05,255 --> 00:38:12,340
and I know that's probably
because my projects are small

719
00:38:07,936 --> 00:38:15,880
and I don't have a ton of
people who are contributing,

720
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:20,411
so I have the opportunity to
do that, but I, I don't, that's

721
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:23,590
how I would like to keep it,
I think because I, I do enjoy

722
00:38:20,411 --> 00:38:26,851
being able to talk to people
about their experiences and

723
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:34,690
to support them in different.
Are there any bigger projects

724
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:37,931
that you've looked at or
have you checked out any

725
00:38:34,721 --> 00:38:39,820
of like the React native
repos that are out there?

726
00:38:40,123 --> 00:38:42,103
Aishwarya: Uh, yeah,
actually I was also looking

727
00:38:42,103 --> 00:38:48,568
at React, uh, repository.
I would like love to

728
00:38:44,668 --> 00:38:48,568
someday contribute somehow.

729
00:38:48,954 --> 00:38:52,224
Bekah: Yeah, it's always fun
to, to see what is out there

730
00:38:52,224 --> 00:38:54,893
and to just like a peek and
see if there's something

731
00:38:54,893 --> 00:38:59,543
that you can contribute to.
A lot of times those ones,

732
00:38:56,668 --> 00:39:02,784
I think that sometimes when
we get into open source, we

733
00:38:59,543 --> 00:39:05,873
think of those projects first.
Like, oh, the big ones,

734
00:39:02,784 --> 00:39:08,963
you know, people always say
contribute to the projects

735
00:39:05,873 --> 00:39:12,023
that you use every day, but
those ones often require a

736
00:39:08,963 --> 00:39:12,954
lot of in-depth knowledge
and understanding of.

737
00:39:13,503 --> 00:39:18,094
Everything and their code
base, and I don't, I think that

738
00:39:18,184 --> 00:39:23,583
many of them, the issues take
a long time to work through

739
00:39:24,094 --> 00:39:26,853
and that can be overwhelming,
especially if you're trying

740
00:39:26,853 --> 00:39:33,423
to hit four pool requests.
I think one year I was doing

741
00:39:30,153 --> 00:39:35,884
octoberfest and I had already
spent like three hours on.

742
00:39:36,869 --> 00:39:39,474
an issue, and I wasn't close
to being done and I was like,

743
00:39:39,653 --> 00:39:45,054
this is never gonna happen.
I'm never going to hit four if

744
00:39:41,094 --> 00:39:48,563
this is what it's going to take.
And I wonder if there's any

745
00:39:45,443 --> 00:39:54,653
information out there about
the average time it takes to

746
00:39:48,833 --> 00:39:58,074
complete four issues into,
I don't, maybe like level

747
00:39:54,893 --> 00:40:02,094
setting, expectation setting,
but do you, what would you

748
00:39:58,344 --> 00:40:03,204
say on average, how long did
it take you to complete an.

749
00:40:03,958 --> 00:40:07,949
Aishwarya: I think for me it
took, uh, like when I started,

750
00:40:07,998 --> 00:40:13,588
it took me around four to five
days, but, uh, the accepting

751
00:40:13,588 --> 00:40:17,862
part is seven days per request.
So it would be more

752
00:40:15,298 --> 00:40:21,429
than that in that.
but average time, I think,

753
00:40:18,518 --> 00:40:26,108
uh, it also depends on what
you're searching for and how

754
00:40:21,429 --> 00:40:30,878
much, uh, you get to work on,
but mostly I think it should

755
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:32,079
be done in 10 days at least.
That's my understanding.

756
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:32,670
Bekah: Yeah,

757
00:40:33,646 --> 00:40:37,085
Aishwarya: I've seen people,
posting tweets, uh, saying

758
00:40:37,445 --> 00:40:40,416
I've completed my third
request on second or third day.

759
00:40:40,922 --> 00:40:43,713
Bekah: I, okay, so I was
one of those people, I don't

760
00:40:43,713 --> 00:40:47,043
think I tweeted about it.
It was like the second day

761
00:40:44,762 --> 00:40:51,003
I got the notification that
I had hit my, and I think

762
00:40:47,043 --> 00:40:55,413
what happened was some, I
had outstanding prs on some

763
00:40:51,003 --> 00:40:58,112
repositories, and then somebody
decided that they should merge

764
00:40:55,418 --> 00:40:59,492
them or something because I
don't know how I got those.

765
00:41:00,503 --> 00:41:02,373
Although I still haven't
gotten my t-shirt yet, so I

766
00:41:02,373 --> 00:41:07,112
hope they don't revoke it.
Like she shouldn't really get

767
00:41:03,512 --> 00:41:08,313
those prs, cuz I don't know.
I don't know where

768
00:41:07,172 --> 00:41:08,313
they came from.

769
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:10,016
Dan: it's

770
00:41:10,425 --> 00:41:10,811
Aishwarya: today.

771
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:15,490
Dan: Oh, really? Today. Nice.
Yeah, I got mine, uh,

772
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:15,490
a week or two ago,

773
00:41:15,586 --> 00:41:19,246
Bekah: Yeah, so
understanding that all of

774
00:41:19,246 --> 00:41:22,936
these things takes time.
And then going back a

775
00:41:20,327 --> 00:41:24,047
little bit to what you
were talking about with.

776
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:28,262
Looking at the issue and seeing
how well it's broken down is

777
00:41:28,262 --> 00:41:32,521
really important for, I, I had,
uh, someone at Virtual Coffee

778
00:41:32,521 --> 00:41:36,842
that I was mentoring their
first octoberfest as well last

779
00:41:36,842 --> 00:41:41,311
year, I think, and they chose
something that said Good first

780
00:41:41,311 --> 00:41:46,711
issue and it required them to
install docker and write tests

781
00:41:46,742 --> 00:41:51,032
and do a, a sub substantial
amount coding, which I thought

782
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:55,291
that's not, there's no way.
that's a good first issue.

783
00:41:56,192 --> 00:41:58,322
I have no, I, I'm
afraid of Docker.

784
00:41:58,322 --> 00:42:04,652
I didn't I don't want to use it.
Um, maybe, maybe one day I will.

785
00:42:04,771 --> 00:42:05,521
It just seems scary.

786
00:42:06,331 --> 00:42:11,202
Dan: Yeah.
Those things that, uh, it's like

787
00:42:07,181 --> 00:42:12,641
if somebody has set everything
up for me, then I'm down.

788
00:42:12,672 --> 00:42:16,047
You know?
But like, I don't, I don't

789
00:42:13,452 --> 00:42:18,972
want to be building my
own whatever, configs and

790
00:42:16,181 --> 00:42:21,043
all that stuff, you know?
it's a, it's another one of

791
00:42:19,512 --> 00:42:22,992
those tools that I'm like,
well, if somebody else does

792
00:42:21,072 --> 00:42:23,773
all the hard work for me,
then I'm fine using it.

793
00:42:24,273 --> 00:42:25,123
Bekah: Yeah. Yeah.

794
00:42:25,452 --> 00:42:26,862
Dan: like, Webpack
the same thing.

795
00:42:26,893 --> 00:42:29,112
I'm like, I don't, I don't
ever want to like specifically

796
00:42:29,112 --> 00:42:31,483
configure this, but, uh,
I'll, I'll use it if somebody

797
00:42:31,603 --> 00:42:32,532
really, really helps me.

798
00:42:33,619 --> 00:42:39,679
Bekah: All right.
We're close to time for

799
00:42:33,949 --> 00:42:41,358
today, but we always, um,
well, this season we're

800
00:42:39,708 --> 00:42:46,068
doing something a little bit
different and we're asking

801
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:47,659
people one word that they would
use to describe themselves.

802
00:42:47,659 --> 00:42:49,789
So what is that one word for you?

803
00:42:50,298 --> 00:42:53,929
Aishwarya: I'd say dedicated
towards what I want to achieve.

804
00:42:54,378 --> 00:42:57,858
And sometimes if I don't
know something, then I'll

805
00:42:57,858 --> 00:43:01,789
like to, uh, Google it myself
and try to find it instead

806
00:43:01,789 --> 00:43:04,219
of, uh, directly saying no.

807
00:43:04,278 --> 00:43:07,909
Bekah: Yeah.
I love that idea of being

808
00:43:04,579 --> 00:43:08,748
dedicated to the things
that you're working on.

809
00:43:08,748 --> 00:43:11,809
Do you have any tips or
advice for people who are

810
00:43:11,838 --> 00:43:15,409
finding it challenging to
be dedicated to what they're

811
00:43:15,409 --> 00:43:16,168
working on right now?

812
00:43:16,414 --> 00:43:19,355
Aishwarya: if it's in the
sense of coding, then I'd say

813
00:43:19,565 --> 00:43:24,172
do not follow, uh, tutorials.
only follow documentation.

814
00:43:24,862 --> 00:43:31,132
Not follow is not a correct word.
Uh, just take a break,

815
00:43:27,831 --> 00:43:36,652
work on some projects.
That is main advice I'd give

816
00:43:31,222 --> 00:43:40,822
my two year back self also that
stop watching tutorials and,

817
00:43:36,652 --> 00:43:44,032
uh, trying to remember things.
It just comes to you

818
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:45,135
when you are constantly
working on things.

819
00:43:45,606 --> 00:43:49,590
Bekah: I love.
Uh, I think that, you know,

820
00:43:46,829 --> 00:43:52,079
it, it's really challenging
to stay dedicated, but you

821
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:54,449
definitely have shown that
you are dedicated, and I

822
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:57,420
love that you use that word
here, talking about these

823
00:43:54,454 --> 00:44:01,980
things, especially when.
You knocked Hacktoberfest

824
00:43:58,110 --> 00:44:04,739
out of the park with your
10 prs merged in this year.

825
00:44:04,739 --> 00:44:09,840
So I, I will second that.
Dedicated is a good word

826
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:12,210
for you and I just wanna
thank you for being a part

827
