1
00:00:05,219 --> 00:00:08,278
Kirk: Hello, and welcome to
season three, episode nine of

2
00:00:08,278 --> 00:00:12,817
the Virtual Coffee podcast. I'm
definitely Bekah.

3
00:00:13,157 --> 00:00:15,137
And this is a podcast that
features members of the

4
00:00:15,147 --> 00:00:19,934
Virtual Coffee community.
Virtual Coffee is an intimate

5
00:00:17,204 --> 00:00:20,925
group of devs at all stages of
their coding journey.

6
00:00:21,135 --> 00:00:23,265
And they're here on this
podcast, sharing their stories.

7
00:00:23,265 --> 00:00:25,725
And what they've learned, we're
here to share with you.

8
00:00:26,085 --> 00:00:28,364
Here with me today is my cohost,
Dan.

9
00:00:29,304 --> 00:00:33,003
Dan: Um, thanks. Definitely
Bekah.

10
00:00:33,003 --> 00:00:35,899
Uh, today we have, uh, a special
episode is the last

11
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:40,999
episode of season three. And so
we are here with

12
00:00:37,789 --> 00:00:44,368
Kirk Shillingford one of our
community maintainers

13
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:48,259
and Bekah is actually here.
Bekah is here and fake Bekah,

14
00:00:44,819 --> 00:00:54,198
all the Bekahs are here. Um, so
we have some exciting

15
00:00:50,959 --> 00:00:58,774
stuff coming up where you are,
um, about to kick into some of

16
00:00:54,228 --> 00:01:01,334
our Hacktoberfest preparations.
And so we thought we would talk

17
00:00:58,814 --> 00:01:04,534
a little bit about Hacktoberfest
last year and what we have going

18
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:07,683
on this year, as well as just
wrap up the season our podcast.

19
00:01:08,073 --> 00:01:10,894
We start every episode of the
podcast like we start every

20
00:01:10,894 --> 00:01:13,743
Virtual Coffee - we introduce
ourselves with our name where

21
00:01:13,743 --> 00:01:16,774
we're from, what we do and a
random check-in question.

22
00:01:17,224 --> 00:01:20,823
Today's question is if you had
to teach one class on one thing

23
00:01:20,823 --> 00:01:25,084
right now, what would you teach?
We hope you enjoy this episode.

24
00:01:33,115 --> 00:01:36,831
Bekah: Hey. I'm Bekah, I'm a
front

25
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:37,911
end developer from a small town
in Ohio.

26
00:01:38,421 --> 00:01:41,150
And if I had to teach one class
right now, like my

27
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,521
initial go-to is like, well,
I've taught English.

28
00:01:43,581 --> 00:01:48,531
I could do that. Um, but I, I
still

29
00:01:45,501 --> 00:01:49,281
don't want to, I'm still burnt
out from that.

30
00:01:49,611 --> 00:01:53,990
So I would probably, I don't
know, like maybe a

31
00:01:54,021 --> 00:02:01,251
kettlebell class or, um, a
patients' rights course for

32
00:02:01,251 --> 00:02:03,831
navigating the medical system.
You know,

33
00:02:04,805 --> 00:02:06,245
Dan: So like, that's going to be
like, a, like a

34
00:02:06,245 --> 00:02:07,296
four year degree for that.

35
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:08,911
Kirk: Yeah.

36
00:02:10,311 --> 00:02:10,941
Bekah: That's what you get.

37
00:02:11,445 --> 00:02:16,545
Dan: Yeah. Fair enough. Um, hi,
I'm Dan I'm a front-end

38
00:02:13,186 --> 00:02:19,485
developer from Cleveland, Ohio,
and a maintainer

39
00:02:16,605 --> 00:02:22,786
here at Virtual Coffee. And, um,
yeah, if I had

40
00:02:19,966 --> 00:02:25,395
to teach a class on one thing, I
mean, I don't know.

41
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,735
There's, there's some computer
stuff I could do, but I think

42
00:02:27,735 --> 00:02:30,496
starting a fire would be my one.
Did we do this before?

43
00:02:30,825 --> 00:02:31,725
Now that I said that.

44
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:33,621
Bekah: Yeah. Now that you said
that that was

45
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:34,251
familiar.

46
00:02:35,256 --> 00:02:36,515
Dan: Oh, maybe we did it in a
coffee.

47
00:02:36,545 --> 00:02:40,506
I hope we didn't do it in a
podcast. All right.

48
00:02:40,506 --> 00:02:44,195
Well, I'm sticking with it. Um,
you know, if we are

49
00:02:41,436 --> 00:02:48,096
repeating questions in the
podcast, please write in

50
00:02:44,195 --> 00:02:51,876
and blame, um, real Bekah who
you heard at the top

51
00:02:48,216 --> 00:02:53,286
of the episode, uh, or fake
Bekah just don't blame Dan.

52
00:02:53,346 --> 00:02:58,475
Um, because, well, you know, I'm
blameless, I'm blameless

53
00:02:59,406 --> 00:03:00,725
in pretty much all situations.

54
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,390
Bekah: is false.

55
00:03:01,992 --> 00:03:05,823
Kirk: um, all right. This is
definitely Bekah.

56
00:03:06,043 --> 00:03:12,013
Although sometimes you can call
me Kirk and, um, class.

57
00:03:12,043 --> 00:03:18,872
I would teach you 100%. It would
be Sudoku I would

58
00:03:14,923 --> 00:03:21,872
teach you all about Sudoku,
regular sort of who,

59
00:03:18,992 --> 00:03:23,552
the different types, the
different cool techniques.

60
00:03:23,973 --> 00:03:26,013
That's a joke. They're all cool
techniques.

61
00:03:27,423 --> 00:03:29,582
yeah, that would, that would
totally be my thing.

62
00:03:29,582 --> 00:03:35,552
And it would be lots of fun.
And, um, if we did this

63
00:03:31,622 --> 00:03:36,812
question before, I didn't do
this question before, so.

64
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:37,786
Bekah: I

65
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:44,381
Dan: Fair enough. So the same.
Do you have a, I do have my

66
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,031
phone and I've never really like
found, uh, an app.

67
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,901
Kirk: I can recommend some good
apps.

68
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:50,881
Dan: Okay.

69
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,700
Kirk: Well, I must clear, I have
four Sudoku apps on

70
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,911
my phone, but each one is a
different type of

71
00:03:54,281 --> 00:03:55,911
Sudoku, so it's not.

72
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,991
Dan: Hmm. Okay. Well, what I
like, what's the,

73
00:03:57,411 --> 00:04:01,700
what's your go-to app for the
like class, like just classic

74
00:04:01,945 --> 00:04:07,346
Kirk: Okay. I have one it's all
bespoke

75
00:04:02,186 --> 00:04:11,695
Sudoku, none of that and machine
generated, you

76
00:04:07,346 --> 00:04:15,145
know, printed press stuff, real
artisan Sudokus, I'm

77
00:04:11,776 --> 00:04:17,716
not even making that up, so,

78
00:04:18,196 --> 00:04:19,125
Dan: Okay. Tell us what it's
called.

79
00:04:19,966 --> 00:04:27,050
Kirk: oh, I just called it WIS.
It's called it's called

80
00:04:24,591 --> 00:04:32,000
classics and docu. Um, there's a
YouTube channel called

81
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:38,661
cracking the cryptic where you
can watch two, um, English

82
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:40,071
puzzle, masters solve Sudoku is
and a variety of other puzzles.

83
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:43,701
And it's just the most lovely
thing in the world to watch

84
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:46,761
a middle lake British man scoff,
a beautiful number.

85
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,685
So, They produce their own app
and they source it

86
00:04:50,685 --> 00:04:53,086
from hustlers that we call
people who make puzzles,

87
00:04:53,086 --> 00:04:57,346
puzzles in the community. And
also though, cause we're

88
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:58,605
really good an app, like helps
you if you need to.

89
00:04:58,605 --> 00:05:00,286
And it gives you like smart
pins, not just

90
00:05:00,286 --> 00:05:03,315
like random hints. It's great.
It's good at classics in

91
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,031
Dan: So,

92
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:04,456
Kirk: the cryptic

93
00:05:05,591 --> 00:05:11,110
Dan: so a puzzler is someone who
creates the puzzles. Okay.

94
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,511
So what's what do you call
somebody who solves puzzle?

95
00:05:14,511 --> 00:05:14,940
Kirk: A Solver

96
00:05:17,646 --> 00:05:18,305
Bekah: That was boring.

97
00:05:19,091 --> 00:05:19,620
Dan: Most boring.

98
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:21,545
Kirk: It's told you about custom

99
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:25,471
Dan: I feel like, I feel like
the Sudoku community needs to,

100
00:05:25,471 --> 00:05:30,060
it needs to up their game, you
know, for making a silly, well,

101
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,120
not silly, but a potential names
for themselves, you know, it's

102
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,071
just not, it's just not there.

103
00:05:35,146 --> 00:05:40,446
Kirk: therapies. We're trying to
really upset around.

104
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:45,295
Bekah: well, speaking of puzzles
and

105
00:05:41,805 --> 00:05:46,545
games, Hacktoberfest sure seems
like that too.

106
00:05:48,576 --> 00:05:52,985
Except we have maintainers and
contributors. See it's there.

107
00:05:53,076 --> 00:05:56,915
That was a really good segue and
everybody should

108
00:05:54,995 --> 00:06:02,076
acknowledge that. So last year
we did

109
00:05:58,985 --> 00:06:06,185
Hacktoberfest for the first
time, and that's kind of what

110
00:06:02,076 --> 00:06:11,930
stands out in my mind as, as
the, uh, When, what, when we

111
00:06:06,216 --> 00:06:15,800
really kind of came into phase
two, a Virtual Coffee, um, when

112
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:19,880
we became something that wasn't
just a pandemic group of people,

113
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:22,610
what is a group of developers at
all stages of the journey

114
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:27,321
that would be around for awhile.
Um, and so, you know,

115
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:29,420
what, what we did last year, we
had an issue.

116
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:33,500
We helped, um, members get their
first contribution

117
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,380
for Hacktoberfest, which had
Tobar Fest.

118
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:42,920
A month long focus on open
source contributions that

119
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:48,471
sponsored by digital ocean. And,
um, once you sign up, I

120
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:52,490
think you have to have four pull
requests and then you can get a

121
00:06:48,471 --> 00:06:55,670
t-shirt and stickers, but it's
really fun and kind of a great

122
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:57,050
way to build community and to
learn more about each other.

123
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,690
I know from my perspective, I
mean, I learned.

124
00:07:00,451 --> 00:07:05,630
Organizing this working with
mentors Um, and,

125
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:08,370
and it was my first time as a
maintainer as well.

126
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:11,911
So, you know, there were so many
lessons that,

127
00:07:11,971 --> 00:07:18,841
that we learned last year. Maybe
if we just talk about like

128
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:23,550
our favorite parts of year, and
then we can move into what we're

129
00:07:18,841 --> 00:07:25,230
taking from that into this year,
um, which I'm really excited.

130
00:07:26,454 --> 00:07:33,805
Dan: Yeah. Um, yes. So favorite
parts from last

131
00:07:28,134 --> 00:07:38,694
year, um, I enjoyed, you know,
last year we decided

132
00:07:33,805 --> 00:07:41,785
to use the website as one of our
repos, um, which meant

133
00:07:38,694 --> 00:07:45,774
we needed to make a website. So,
um, so we did that

134
00:07:42,415 --> 00:07:46,285
pretty quickly and, um,

135
00:07:46,694 --> 00:07:47,714
Bekah: you mean you.

136
00:07:47,995 --> 00:07:53,689
Dan: okay. The, the war, the
Royal we,

137
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:58,670
and, um, One of the things that
we pulled together was,

138
00:07:53,689 --> 00:08:01,759
um, making it an, uh, an, an
issue for having people add

139
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:04,310
themselves to the, to their
members directory, um, via code.

140
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:09,199
And we created an issue and, you
know, created, you

141
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,029
know, set up some guidelines and
stuff like that.

142
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:13,399
And then had a kickoff meeting
altogether where w where we

143
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:16,790
could get everybody going on,
um, submitting a poll request.

144
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,180
In a zoom meeting and that was a
lot of fun.

145
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:25,370
It was fun. We, we got, um, I
think

146
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:27,350
everybody got it done. We had,
um, shout out to Marie.

147
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:30,199
I'm pretty sure who rescued me
at one point because somebody

148
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:33,919
was having problem with, um, git
on the command line and I don't

149
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:39,210
use git on the command don't uh,
and so I didn't know how to,

150
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:42,440
I'm a guy that I was like, I, I
mean, I, I made sure to before

151
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,830
the event, um, practice, you
know, the very simple things.

152
00:08:46,669 --> 00:08:49,190
This was, we ran into something
that was, wasn't simple on.

153
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,870
I had no idea. Marie swooped

154
00:08:50,955 --> 00:08:51,014
Kirk: Yeah.

155
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,250
Dan: with her superhero Cape
and, uh, rescued my rescued me.

156
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,840
Um, so shout out to Marie for
that.

157
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:00,620
But, uh, it was a lot of fun.
Um, just the event the whole

158
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:03,529
month was like that, uh, the
whole month, it was just, uh,

159
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:06,289
all members kind of ended up
being excited and, and we had

160
00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:11,700
a, it was fun to have a goal,
you know, to everybody could

161
00:09:06,409 --> 00:09:13,230
celebrate, you know, I dunno, it
was fun, but yeah, that,

162
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,490
that first meeting is the thing
that pops into my mind.

163
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,429
Um, when I think of Virtual
Coffee last year and

164
00:09:16,429 --> 00:09:22,620
Hacktoberfest, what about you?
Oh, I was trying to think

165
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,620
of a Keka that's awful.

166
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,230
Kirk: You can just, you can just
go Kirk.

167
00:09:27,004 --> 00:09:27,125
Bekah: Yeah.

168
00:09:27,629 --> 00:09:32,220
Kirk: Um, yeah, last, last
Hacktoberfest, I mean, it

169
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:37,399
was a lot of firsts for me. I, I
like, I think a lot

170
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:40,409
of people don't know this. My
very first like open

171
00:09:37,409 --> 00:09:42,470
source pull requests was just a
couple months before.

172
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,370
On the self-defined project run
by Tatyana Mack,

173
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:55,529
who was super amazing. But, um,
I feel like I had

174
00:09:48,929 --> 00:09:58,710
spent a long time not doing like
anything coding or

175
00:09:55,679 --> 00:10:00,960
tech related on the side. Just
like, especially when

176
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:06,179
I've been working by myself. Um,
and Hacktoberfest was I sort

177
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:08,039
of first opportunity to start
doing stuff with other people.

178
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:12,000
I was also my first time. Uh,
hosting an open

179
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,669
source project. My first time,
like teaching

180
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:17,039
other people, like formally like
Elm and getting into

181
00:10:14,669 --> 00:10:23,700
functional programming. I, in a
similar fashion to Dan

182
00:10:18,509 --> 00:10:27,600
may have gone a little overboard
with my, my piece of it, writing

183
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:32,419
weights and much documentation.
Um, but it, it felt really

184
00:10:28,649 --> 00:10:36,590
good to kind of like, you know,
my, uh, thoughts to try and

185
00:10:32,509 --> 00:10:43,184
make something good for them.
And I think it was just

186
00:10:37,455 --> 00:10:45,794
really, really fun and
empowering and validating to

187
00:10:43,245 --> 00:10:50,445
see so many people say like this
was my first PR Right.

188
00:10:50,445 --> 00:10:52,784
And like the fact that we can
get that for some people

189
00:10:52,784 --> 00:10:54,674
and they could have a good
experience with it and not a

190
00:10:54,674 --> 00:10:58,304
painful experience with it. That
felt good.

191
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:01,394
And I'm super pumped for doing
that again.

192
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:05,654
Dan: Yeah, I, uh, I learned
that, Kirk, I mean, yeah,

193
00:11:05,684 --> 00:11:08,414
Kirk, Kirk did a ton of work
getting our, uh, open-source

194
00:11:08,414 --> 00:11:11,235
stuff set up and, uh, putting
some guidelines in place.

195
00:11:11,235 --> 00:11:13,904
And I don't know, I learned a
lot, um, we're working

196
00:11:13,904 --> 00:11:16,365
with Kirk on that too. really
cool.

197
00:11:17,115 --> 00:11:18,195
Bekah, what about you?

198
00:11:19,424 --> 00:11:22,154
Bekah: Yeah, I think, you know,
it's, it all comes

199
00:11:22,154 --> 00:11:25,274
down to the people, right? It
was such a big

200
00:11:23,205 --> 00:11:31,024
learning experience. I feel
like. I learned so much in the

201
00:11:26,434 --> 00:11:34,924
month prep and the month of
doing it, that it, it

202
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:36,125
was like an intense amount of
learning that happened.

203
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:37,894
I was so exhausted afterwards,
but

204
00:11:38,284 --> 00:11:41,404
it was so great to be able to
work with other people

205
00:11:41,404 --> 00:11:43,774
and kind of learn about the
deliberate process

206
00:11:43,774 --> 00:11:47,615
that goes into documenting
things and creating issues.

207
00:11:47,615 --> 00:11:50,095
And the difference between
working on your.

208
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:55,009
Own open source project and then
having people work on it, it

209
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:59,840
was, you know, a lot in working
on my postpartum wellness app

210
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:03,019
with members of the community
and working through issues and

211
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:06,710
how to write issues, but then
also, know, pairing up with

212
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:10,309
them and talking through things
and hearing their stories and

213
00:12:10,309 --> 00:12:14,870
their connection to, know, both
the code, but also the, um,

214
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:19,009
topic that we were working on.
It just became

215
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:22,325
something that couldn't. I would
have never imagined

216
00:12:19,715 --> 00:12:24,335
that it would be that special
and meaningful to me.

217
00:12:24,335 --> 00:12:27,424
So, you know, I really just love
that.

218
00:12:28,085 --> 00:12:30,485
like we all just like really
close together

219
00:12:30,514 --> 00:12:32,225
in that experience.

220
00:12:32,692 --> 00:12:36,562
Dan: Yeah, totally. Um, I mean,
I agree.

221
00:12:37,403 --> 00:12:44,013
Um, we, we talk a lot about.
That the Hacktoberfest last

222
00:12:41,702 --> 00:12:47,673
year was, was sort of where
Virtual Coffee became, you

223
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:50,822
know, more of a, I dunno, I
dunno what, the more of a

224
00:12:49,052 --> 00:12:51,302
thing, you know what I mean? Um,

225
00:12:52,118 --> 00:12:52,298
Bekah: Like

226
00:12:52,503 --> 00:12:53,133
Dan: than just, uh,

227
00:12:53,238 --> 00:12:53,307
Bekah: know.

228
00:12:53,493 --> 00:12:57,212
Dan: yeah, solidified I dunno,
sort of a mission or something.

229
00:12:57,212 --> 00:13:00,722
I don't, I don't know, but,
yeah, know.

230
00:13:00,732 --> 00:13:01,322
It was a lot of fun.

231
00:13:02,832 --> 00:13:07,416
Kirk: Yeah. I think before,
virtual Coffee

232
00:13:03,163 --> 00:13:12,485
was, you know, we, we definitely
sort of established the space

233
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:16,235
and, you know, we were, we were
having fun together and

234
00:13:12,485 --> 00:13:20,436
we were definitely like forming
those like good and healthy

235
00:13:16,235 --> 00:13:24,816
connections and relationships
feel like Hacktoberfest

236
00:13:21,395 --> 00:13:30,066
was, when we sort of like the
opportunity to do a lot

237
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:30,725
of good in the tech space. Like

238
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:30,831
Bekah: Yeah.

239
00:13:31,296 --> 00:13:33,456
Kirk: some of the big gaps And
then like, you

240
00:13:33,456 --> 00:13:36,245
know, also like feeling
empowered to change them. Right.

241
00:13:36,245 --> 00:13:38,975
Because if all started with that
question of, we all want

242
00:13:38,975 --> 00:13:40,895
to do something for open source,
we all have this feeling like,

243
00:13:40,895 --> 00:13:43,100
why does that ever feel good?
No. Why do people have so many,

244
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,305
so.

245
00:13:45,306 --> 00:13:47,615
much trouble with this? Why
other people find

246
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:49,145
it so intimidating? we tried to
solve it.

247
00:13:49,176 --> 00:13:51,816
And, you know, once we did that,
we sort of get on a

248
00:13:51,816 --> 00:13:54,285
roll with the next month and the
month after that

249
00:13:54,285 --> 00:14:02,166
of, let's keep trying to. Like
these things just

250
00:13:56,946 --> 00:14:03,186
like together or both at the
same time in that.

251
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:06,379
Bekah: Yeah. There's so many
people

252
00:14:03,769 --> 00:14:07,370
that suggest getting into open
source.

253
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:11,080
Um, if you're new or you're
getting into the industry,

254
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,279
and I've always found that
that's not necessarily the

255
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,929
best advice because open source
projects are open to

256
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,539
new and entry-level people, some
of them are welcoming

257
00:14:22,539 --> 00:14:26,529
and some of them aren't. And so
what ends up happening

258
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:29,929
is it can be a really isolating
experience and

259
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:32,664
one that doesn't leave you.
Well, the, a good taste in

260
00:14:30,445 --> 00:14:34,764
your mouth, like, oh yeah. I
want to continue to be

261
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:37,014
part of this community. Um,
because there can

262
00:14:35,154 --> 00:14:38,274
be some really bad experiences
out there.

263
00:14:38,605 --> 00:14:40,554
And I think, you know, that
really.

264
00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:44,899
Um, stands out to me, as
everybody talked about

265
00:14:45,049 --> 00:14:48,620
how great it was to be doing
this thing together.

266
00:14:48,649 --> 00:14:51,320
People who had been in tech for
years, who had not done it

267
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:55,759
before doing it for the first
time, it was part of a community

268
00:14:55,789 --> 00:15:00,500
and it was a sense of belonging.
And there is a greater

269
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:03,169
purpose when you're doing it
with other people that

270
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:06,500
you trust around you. it, you
know, it allows

271
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:10,399
you to grow and new ways. Um,
and so I think, you

272
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:13,759
know, bringing that into what
we're doing this year makes

273
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:17,870
it even more exciting and more
purposeful because we

274
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:22,039
know that this has happened once
before and we have

275
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:25,490
grown a ton since last year.
this year, it it's really

276
00:15:22,549 --> 00:15:28,100
exciting to kind of off of what
we've done.

277
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:30,149
Dan, do you want to kind of talk
about what our

278
00:15:30,149 --> 00:15:31,289
plans are heading into?

279
00:15:32,955 --> 00:15:38,125
Dan: Yeah, absolutely. So
digital ocean, you know, um,

280
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:40,575
has been running Hacktoberfest
and they, so they coined

281
00:15:38,144 --> 00:15:41,924
the term Preptember, right. Uh,
for September.

282
00:15:41,924 --> 00:15:44,865
And the idea there for in
DigitalOcean's mind

283
00:15:44,865 --> 00:15:46,455
is Preptember is for
maintainers, right?

284
00:15:46,455 --> 00:15:49,875
So Preptember is get, um, get
your repositories ready.

285
00:15:49,904 --> 00:15:55,710
Um, People to contribute. Right.
And they have a lot of,

286
00:15:53,669 --> 00:16:00,360
they have a lot of good, uh,
resources out there for things

287
00:15:55,769 --> 00:16:01,980
like, um, you know, creating
issues and adding, contributing

288
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,259
guides, stuff like that. And so
that was, you

289
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:06,419
know, we're, we're, we're going
to also piggyback

290
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:09,990
on that a little bit. Um, we
want to help maintainers,

291
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:13,200
um, get things ready. We, we, I
feel like we have

292
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:16,470
done a pretty good job on, in
our own internal stuff

293
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:19,230
of adding a lot of the community
health things that

294
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:21,370
you want to see a lot of the.
Some of the organizational

295
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,970
stuff, things that we want to
see.

296
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,289
Um, and so we can use that, some
of that as a guide and,

297
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:30,460
um, provide some help for both,
uh, existing maintainers

298
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:33,039
that want to sort of just make
sure they're checking all the

299
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:36,580
boxes and, uh, anybody who wants
to create a new open

300
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:41,860
source project to figure out.
You know what things to do,

301
00:16:39,789 --> 00:16:44,169
what things to hit, um, when,
when you're creating a project

302
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:47,950
so that you don't end up with
the random bits of code, the

303
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:49,539
default, read me with, you know,
just a header and that's it.

304
00:16:49,539 --> 00:16:51,669
Right. Um, so someone, somebody
who comes to contribute,

305
00:16:52,029 --> 00:16:57,190
uh, they can help. And then the,
for us, for

306
00:16:53,470 --> 00:17:00,639
Virtual Coffee, we will also
want it to have something this

307
00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:03,610
month for, um, our members who
may you know, who aren't

308
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:07,525
maintainers of open-source
projects and, uh, The other

309
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:11,065
thing we thought about was
creating a, I don't know, a

310
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:14,035
challenge, you know, using our
mental challenge set

311
00:17:11,065 --> 00:17:16,404
up and, um, helping people learn
how to create good

312
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:19,825
issues for repositories, because
I personally feel

313
00:17:16,404 --> 00:17:21,805
like that is one of the, like,
that is actually one of the

314
00:17:19,884 --> 00:17:24,565
strongest things you can do to
contribute, um, especially to

315
00:17:21,835 --> 00:17:27,714
big projects, even the little
projects, uh, writing an issue.

316
00:17:27,775 --> 00:17:31,525
Um, you know, I don't know if
you find something.

317
00:17:32,394 --> 00:17:35,365
It he's either wrong or you'd
like to, uh, help improve

318
00:17:35,365 --> 00:17:40,704
or, or everything like that.
every, almost every

319
00:17:37,434 --> 00:17:42,414
maintainer will prefer you to
create an issue first. Right.

320
00:17:42,474 --> 00:17:46,704
And that way the maintainers can
process them and,

321
00:17:46,704 --> 00:17:50,605
you know, check and see. but
also, you know, if

322
00:17:48,444 --> 00:17:52,375
you see something that's wrong,
lots of times. Okay.

323
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:53,575
So does it happen personally?
Right?

324
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:56,005
I have, I've been trying to
install a package or something.

325
00:17:56,664 --> 00:18:01,519
I follow the, read me. It
doesn't work and I. Okay.

326
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:03,309
I mean, you know, whatever, I'm
busy, I'm pressed

327
00:18:03,309 --> 00:18:06,750
for time or whatever. And, uh,
you know, I just

328
00:18:04,269 --> 00:18:10,390
like, oh, this thing is broken.
And so I just move on, you

329
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:12,190
know, and, um, a possibly better
approach would

330
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:15,640
be to write an issue. Right. But
you can't just say

331
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:17,829
this is broken and move on.
Cause that's just as

332
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,640
helpful, you know, like that's
not hopefully there.

333
00:18:19,269 --> 00:18:22,000
Um, so that's, that's our other,
we're doing a

334
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,950
two-pronged Preptember, right?
Right. Some issues for some

335
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:31,644
repositories and, uh, you know
how to do it well, How to,

336
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:34,825
you know, both, uh, set up and
create or create, um, um,

337
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:37,884
your open source project with,
with a good, you know, with a

338
00:18:34,914 --> 00:18:38,394
good setup of support, um, for
maintainers.

339
00:18:42,025 --> 00:18:45,085
it starts tomorrow, as of our
recording, it

340
00:18:45,085 --> 00:18:48,115
starts September 1st. So, um,
which will probably be

341
00:18:45,954 --> 00:18:48,115
when this comes out, actually.

342
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:53,519
Bekah: Yeah. And, you know, I
think contributors

343
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:57,359
write issues also does a really
good job of kind of showing.

344
00:18:58,255 --> 00:19:01,974
What it takes to be a maintainer
or what's useful

345
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:06,744
way to approach a problem. so,
and I think it helps

346
00:19:04,525 --> 00:19:08,184
to create those clear paths of
communication.

347
00:19:09,025 --> 00:19:12,355
now, Kirk, I know that you did a
lot with maintainers last year.

348
00:19:12,355 --> 00:19:14,845
You're working on a checklist
for maintainers this year.

349
00:19:15,174 --> 00:19:17,845
What are some of the big things
that you think

350
00:19:18,414 --> 00:19:22,315
maintainers should be for as
they prepare their

351
00:19:22,315 --> 00:19:24,015
repositories for Hacktoberfest?

352
00:19:25,829 --> 00:19:30,240
Kirk: Uh, there's part of me
wants to say

353
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:33,900
there's quite a bit. And then
another part of

354
00:19:31,289 --> 00:19:35,609
me wants to say it's like less
than people think.

355
00:19:36,579 --> 00:19:41,714
There are some basic like files
that we know usually helped to,

356
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:44,924
to just have like having the
good reading and like knowing

357
00:19:44,924 --> 00:19:48,105
what makes a good reasoning, um,
contributing, like telling

358
00:19:48,105 --> 00:19:51,075
people, Hey, here's the way you
contribute to this code

359
00:19:51,075 --> 00:19:54,585
base in the way that works for
you as the maintainer, right.

360
00:19:54,914 --> 00:19:59,265
Having a code of conduct. So
establishing very early

361
00:19:56,174 --> 00:20:02,654
on the types of behaviors you
expect while interacting with

362
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:03,795
the code base and interacting
with other people contributing.

363
00:20:04,424 --> 00:20:08,244
Um, as you said, It's all about
communication.

364
00:20:09,295 --> 00:20:15,414
And I think a lot of times
maintainers it's like, we sort

365
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:18,055
of think of open source in this
very transactional way.

366
00:20:18,055 --> 00:20:20,454
Like I have code base use of it
to code base.

367
00:20:20,664 --> 00:20:24,414
I take something, you know,
it's, it's, it's a team, right?

368
00:20:24,414 --> 00:20:26,484
It's, it's an ad hoc team. It's
a distributed team.

369
00:20:26,515 --> 00:20:28,974
But while that person is trying
to work with your code, they're

370
00:20:28,974 --> 00:20:31,974
kind of like your teammate. So
in the same way you would.

371
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,589
Keep a teammate teammate aware
of like, what's going on.

372
00:20:35,589 --> 00:20:37,720
You kind of do the same thing
with, uh, with contributors.

373
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,720
So I usually encourage
maintainers, like, Hey, think

374
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,059
about the way you want to
interact with this code base.

375
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:46,299
And just like a lot of it's just
like giving folks a heads up.

376
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:52,210
I work on this, on the weekends.
So if you submit a request,

377
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:55,150
you know, expect a review by the
weekend, or like,

378
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:57,700
Hey, sometimes I slip up. So if
you notice it's been a

379
00:20:55,210 --> 00:21:00,970
couple of weeks or a couple of
days with no response, me

380
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:03,190
a message on the appropriate
channel where you wish

381
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:04,930
to receive messages about your
open source code base.

382
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:07,660
if there are a lot of things
like that, but I don't feel

383
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:13,150
like we talk about a lot. We
talked about making the

384
00:21:09,849 --> 00:21:14,880
issue or making the PR, I think
those subtleties.

385
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:19,690
As a maintainer find the way you
want to be interacted

386
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:22,869
with and make that super clear
for people, um,

387
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:27,640
that can be super helpful. then
for your contributors,

388
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:30,250
then they don't have that burden
of trying to decide if they're

389
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:32,380
bothering you or frustrating.
And that goes back to

390
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:33,309
what Dan said about like what's
a good issue.

391
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,240
You know, a good issue for a
maintainer is something they

392
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:41,289
can see like make decisions on.
I need to fix this?

393
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:46,315
Can I let this person fix it?
Um, is this a big problem that

394
00:21:43,525 --> 00:21:48,325
we need to pair up more on? Can
we break this

395
00:21:46,585 --> 00:21:52,615
into smaller chunks? so, you
know, it's, it's

396
00:21:49,285 --> 00:21:54,025
about like building a healthy
working relationship.

397
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:56,994
And a lot of that is people
being open, honest with

398
00:21:56,994 --> 00:21:59,214
like where they're at and what
they can accomplish.

399
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:03,530
Bekah: I really love that idea
of this is your team

400
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:07,641
that you're working with. And so
if you're thinking

401
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,611
of, okay, now you have all of
these brand new

402
00:22:07,671 --> 00:22:12,141
teammates who are going to be
working on your repository.

403
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:15,080
How do you onboard them all at
once? Right.

404
00:22:15,631 --> 00:22:17,941
It, it starts there, you know,
what the clear

405
00:22:17,941 --> 00:22:20,550
paths of communication and do
you lay that out?

406
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:23,730
How do you demonstrate that you
are a friendly

407
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:27,090
repository for people to come
and work on things?

408
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:32,221
I talked to, um, a maintainer of
a really large

409
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:40,320
a couple of months ago. one of
the challenges that he

410
00:22:35,161 --> 00:22:46,086
said was, so hard to find people
to continue being maintainers

411
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:47,615
for the project because Was
self-described as older.

412
00:22:47,645 --> 00:22:50,375
And he said the other
maintainers are older and

413
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:54,576
they could really use, new
people to take it over.

414
00:22:55,536 --> 00:22:59,796
it's a catch 22 almost because
so many of the maintainers

415
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:03,695
don't want to spend the time to
work with new contributors.

416
00:23:04,236 --> 00:23:07,625
ultimately those would be the
perfect candidates once they

417
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:09,935
understood the repository and
how to work through

418
00:23:09,935 --> 00:23:13,885
things, it over for a while. Um,
and I think.

419
00:23:14,506 --> 00:23:17,296
You know, going back to what
we're doing and making

420
00:23:17,296 --> 00:23:21,256
sure that we, um, work with all
of our members at all

421
00:23:21,256 --> 00:23:27,405
different levels and stages.
Like that's the investment that

422
00:23:22,996 --> 00:23:29,625
we put into, these repositories.
We, we make sure that

423
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:32,476
people have mentors. We make
sure that there are

424
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:36,346
repositories that are friendly
to them and that these

425
00:23:32,476 --> 00:23:40,965
it's about developing the
relationships that go and create

426
00:23:36,346 --> 00:23:42,165
community around your project.
So you can sustain and grow.

427
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:46,317
Dan: Yeah, I love that. And
like, that's, that's

428
00:23:44,194 --> 00:23:47,607
one of the support things that
we w we try to do too.

429
00:23:47,657 --> 00:23:49,798
And this stuff that we're
talking about is time consuming

430
00:23:49,798 --> 00:23:54,508
from a maintainers perspective,
you know, and there are a lot

431
00:23:54,508 --> 00:23:56,907
of projects out there where, um,
I feel like there are

432
00:23:56,907 --> 00:23:59,067
people that would be open to
country contributions, you

433
00:23:59,067 --> 00:24:02,907
know, maybe haven't spelled out
every single thing that

434
00:24:02,907 --> 00:24:06,268
they could or whatever. And one
of the things that

435
00:24:03,748 --> 00:24:07,377
we can do at like, that we do do
as a community is.

436
00:24:08,288 --> 00:24:10,807
Is maybe provide support for our
contributors to

437
00:24:10,837 --> 00:24:14,647
navigate, you know, different,
different areas of repositories

438
00:24:14,647 --> 00:24:18,667
and, and what's to you. Cause
none of them are

439
00:24:15,367 --> 00:24:21,817
ever going to be perfect. Right?
Uh, no, no project is going

440
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:26,978
to have everything laid out. Um,
some will get close, you

441
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:28,928
know, but, um, anyway, uh, that
that's like one of the other

442
00:24:26,978 --> 00:24:30,458
things that we do once, like
once Hacktoberfest starts is.

443
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:34,782
Is provide support and
mentorship in some time, you

444
00:24:34,782 --> 00:24:37,722
know, in some places for people,
uh, format for our members to

445
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:40,782
kind of work through some of the
social, you know, some of

446
00:24:40,782 --> 00:24:44,712
the like social anxiety that
can, that can, that can happen.

447
00:24:44,742 --> 00:24:47,833
Um, when, you know, when
contributing to open source.

448
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:52,454
Kirk: Yeah. I think you touched
on something

449
00:24:48,845 --> 00:24:59,865
very important that are just
like how scary it is to offer,

450
00:24:52,454 --> 00:25:02,835
to help someone on project that
like, you feel like, oh, I

451
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:04,365
don't particularly understand.
And it's all this code.

452
00:25:04,904 --> 00:25:08,565
And especially if you're an
early career developer, like,

453
00:25:08,595 --> 00:25:11,625
oh, I'm just, I just got here.
I'm going to mess something up.

454
00:25:12,105 --> 00:25:16,184
There's so many. It's something
that we

455
00:25:13,424 --> 00:25:20,884
don't really do in other
circumstances, there's a lot

456
00:25:16,184 --> 00:25:24,815
of anxiety around it and sort of
anything you can do too,

457
00:25:20,884 --> 00:25:30,154
as a maintainer to make people
feel more welcome is, is like

458
00:25:24,815 --> 00:25:33,125
worth it, know, and getting back
to September, like you said,

459
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:35,855
like this, this year, we want it
to not just be Preptember

460
00:25:33,125 --> 00:25:39,275
for maintainers, but also
Preptember for contributors,

461
00:25:35,855 --> 00:25:42,065
you know, we're, we're going to
be doing, you know, a couple of

462
00:25:39,275 --> 00:25:46,964
talks in a couple of seconds.
You know, to show people what

463
00:25:42,914 --> 00:25:51,555
contribution looks like, but
also to let them see like not

464
00:25:46,964 --> 00:25:55,035
scary it is and how approachable
it can be, you know, just

465
00:25:51,615 --> 00:25:58,275
to we can do to kind of like get
through those layers of

466
00:25:55,755 --> 00:26:00,525
anxiety and get to that place
where it's like, no, they,

467
00:25:58,275 --> 00:26:01,515
they want me to be here. They
want me to help.

468
00:26:01,815 --> 00:26:06,194
They're okay with me learning.
They're willing to sort of,

469
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:10,065
you know, guide them along. Um,
and that's when I think you

470
00:26:06,825 --> 00:26:11,625
get to see people really, really
shine and like really enjoy.

471
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:15,720
Uh, making contributions to
group projects.

472
00:26:16,276 --> 00:26:18,675
Dan: So you mentioned some
stuff, some, some events I

473
00:26:18,675 --> 00:26:20,355
just wanted to kind of run
through a couple of the ones

474
00:26:20,355 --> 00:26:23,465
that we have for September. Um,
if that's all

475
00:26:21,665 --> 00:26:27,846
right, real quick. September
3rd, which is

476
00:26:24,425 --> 00:26:32,375
this Friday, we, I will be doing
an event, a lunch

477
00:26:27,846 --> 00:26:33,395
and learn event at noon Um, and,
and it's just an open.

478
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,855
So what's called the open source
project walkthrough.

479
00:26:36,846 --> 00:26:40,056
And this just sort of a tour,
uh, not really a deep

480
00:26:40,506 --> 00:26:43,736
dive into any con you know,
contributing, uh, any, any,

481
00:26:43,865 --> 00:26:45,816
anything as far as like pull
requests or anything like that.

482
00:26:45,816 --> 00:26:49,296
But, just a tour of what a, what
a repository looks like.

483
00:26:49,296 --> 00:26:51,006
What are all the different
pieces that happen?

484
00:26:51,066 --> 00:26:54,726
Um, looks like from the
maintainers perspective,

485
00:26:54,786 --> 00:27:00,336
um, on a project and, uh, We'll
just kind of it around.

486
00:27:00,556 --> 00:27:03,665
It's not going to be a, it's not
going to be super

487
00:27:03,665 --> 00:27:07,036
in depth, um, but it'll be kind
of fun and we'll, know,

488
00:27:07,036 --> 00:27:08,796
we'll hang out and ask some
questions and stuff like that.

489
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:12,455
Um, and so that's me, that's
Friday, September

490
00:27:12,455 --> 00:27:17,046
17th is a lunch and learn, um,
how to create an open

491
00:27:17,046 --> 00:27:22,415
source or a repository. And so
this is Kirk, um, at

492
00:27:18,756 --> 00:27:26,375
September 17th at noon Eastern.
And this is sort of geared

493
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:28,461
towards maintainers or. People
who'd like

494
00:27:27,141 --> 00:27:30,500
to be maintainers. kind of, and
this is kind

495
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:31,250
of what we touched about and
touched on a couple of times.

496
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,111
What kinds of things should we
look at when we're, when

497
00:27:33,111 --> 00:27:35,300
we're, we're talking, thinking
about creating an open

498
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:38,361
source project, um, because it's
not just the code.

499
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,790
Like we've talked about a bunch
of times, right?

500
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:44,361
It's not just the code. Uh,
there's a lot of things

501
00:27:41,961 --> 00:27:47,750
we can do to help, to help, uh,
contributors actually

502
00:27:44,451 --> 00:27:50,631
contribute to your project. So
that is 17th.

503
00:27:50,721 --> 00:27:57,421
And then am what we got the 24.
Um, which is the last Friday

504
00:27:54,601 --> 00:28:00,931
I feel like probably in
September is, uh, this is

505
00:27:57,421 --> 00:28:04,530
our intro to Hacktoberfest and,
um, and open-source

506
00:28:00,931 --> 00:28:06,990
contributions, hosted by Bekah
but I'm pretty sure

507
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:09,661
we'll, we'll, I'll be there. Um,
and this is a general

508
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:13,155
Hacktoberfest, you know, Jumping
into everything event.

509
00:28:13,215 --> 00:28:16,336
Um, I guess I should have
probably asked if Kirk, if you

510
00:28:16,336 --> 00:28:20,806
had anything to say about her,
your event, uh, uh, just

511
00:28:18,375 --> 00:28:23,586
realized I was about to do
either of you would

512
00:28:20,806 --> 00:28:24,496
like to, you know, expand more
on what I said.

513
00:28:24,615 --> 00:28:27,855
Um, but those, the events coming
up, uh, this month,

514
00:28:28,455 --> 00:28:29,115
I'm excited about it.

515
00:28:30,471 --> 00:28:33,891
Kirk: Um, I think he covered the
basis.

516
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:36,290
It's it's going to be much what
it says.

517
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:40,941
We're going to start from
scratch with a, Hey, I have

518
00:28:40,941 --> 00:28:45,270
something locally and I want to
get it up on GitHub.

519
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:48,351
I want it to be open source and
I want to do

520
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:50,931
the necessary things that people
know that they can

521
00:28:49,401 --> 00:28:54,185
come here and work here. We will
cover the required docs.

522
00:28:54,246 --> 00:28:57,695
We'll, we'll get some helpful,
get up features for making that

523
00:28:57,695 --> 00:29:00,276
process easier because they have
invested a lot of resources

524
00:29:00,756 --> 00:29:05,645
into that type of thing. Uh,
we'll cover a few things

525
00:29:02,736 --> 00:29:08,736
that GitHub doesn't really tell
you about the, you sort

526
00:29:05,645 --> 00:29:13,145
of learn from our work with PC
and just all the other cool

527
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:17,586
projects in the community. So, I
mean, totally recommended

528
00:29:13,625 --> 00:29:18,665
for anyone who wants to start an
open source.

529
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,621
Anyone who already has one and
they just want to get like a

530
00:29:21,621 --> 00:29:24,951
refresher on what are the cool
things happening nowadays to

531
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:28,221
make it engaging, even if you're
a contributor where you just

532
00:29:28,221 --> 00:29:30,320
want to see like, Hey, like what
actually goes into this?

533
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,351
I might want to do this next
year or a couple

534
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:37,280
months down the line. Um, I
think all, all three

535
00:29:33,681 --> 00:29:39,951
of our events will be super
useful for anyone at any

536
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:40,256
Bekah: Yeah.

537
00:29:40,401 --> 00:29:42,351
Kirk: part of the OSS. Uh,

538
00:29:44,451 --> 00:29:47,391
Bekah: Yeah, and I always
appreciate everybody coming.

539
00:29:47,391 --> 00:29:50,540
If somebody is very experienced
and has done it before and

540
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:53,931
has things to offer and can
answer questions too, you know,

541
00:29:53,931 --> 00:29:56,901
it's great to have a variety of
voices from the community

542
00:29:56,901 --> 00:30:00,050
who can talk about the things
and, you know, we'll start

543
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:03,800
with, you know, what is hacked
Tober Fest, um, because you

544
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,016
know, Plenty of people who've
been in tech for a long time

545
00:30:07,046 --> 00:30:10,165
and they're not familiar with
Oktoberfest and it's okay.

546
00:30:10,165 --> 00:30:12,415
It just depends on, you know,
the, the circles

547
00:30:12,415 --> 00:30:15,986
that you hang around. Right. Um,
to have exposure to that.

548
00:30:16,316 --> 00:30:19,135
Uh, I think I, I was just in the
like, free t-shirt.

549
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:23,000
Groups everywhere. And I was
like, you go.

550
00:30:24,381 --> 00:30:29,391
so we'll get you set up, learn
how to, sign up for that.

551
00:30:29,391 --> 00:30:33,230
Learn about how to find
repositories that that eligible

552
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:38,691
for Hacktoberfest and talk
through what it's like to work

553
00:30:38,691 --> 00:30:43,971
your way through an issue about,
um, Creating a pull request

554
00:30:43,971 --> 00:30:47,421
and, and some tips for doing
that or asking questions along

555
00:30:47,421 --> 00:30:50,990
the way, but we'll definitely
prioritize answering anyone's

556
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:56,260
questions at that point. Um,
just to make sure that

557
00:30:52,611 --> 00:30:58,721
everybody feels comfortable and
everyone feels comfortable

558
00:30:56,260 --> 00:31:00,461
asking whatever questions they
feel like asking. Right.

559
00:31:00,461 --> 00:31:04,391
It's okay to ask all of the
questions because

560
00:31:04,391 --> 00:31:06,221
that's what we're here for.
We're here to answer them.

561
00:31:08,526 --> 00:31:10,086
Dan: Plus, I think we all like
talking about it.

562
00:31:10,685 --> 00:31:13,415
I always want people to ask
questions because it's just fun.

563
00:31:13,476 --> 00:31:15,695
It's just fun to talk about all
this stuff for me, you know?

564
00:31:15,695 --> 00:31:21,076
And, um, it's a. I like it can
be anxiety inducing.

565
00:31:21,076 --> 00:31:23,655
It was, it was for me, uh,
certainly like getting, getting

566
00:31:23,655 --> 00:31:27,826
started and, um, the, you know,
getting started with open

567
00:31:27,826 --> 00:31:30,746
source, especially, especially
contributing to like, to

568
00:31:30,846 --> 00:31:33,405
projects of people who you don't
know the people, right.

569
00:31:33,405 --> 00:31:34,935
You don't know the maintainers
and everything.

570
00:31:34,996 --> 00:31:39,046
Um, it doesn't have to be at, I
think the, me, I think

571
00:31:39,046 --> 00:31:42,846
the way that you get over it.
The best way to get over

572
00:31:40,625 --> 00:31:46,175
that anxiety is to, is to just
kind of get started, you

573
00:31:42,846 --> 00:31:47,496
know, um, uh, ask questions, you
know, all of that stuff.

574
00:31:47,526 --> 00:31:49,445
And then, and then, and then we
can kind of dive in.

575
00:31:49,445 --> 00:31:51,905
And so that's why that's, that's
gonna be our process

576
00:31:51,905 --> 00:31:55,056
again this year, you know? Um,
well this event

577
00:31:52,895 --> 00:31:58,865
should be fun. Uh, like on the
24th, that Beck

578
00:31:55,145 --> 00:32:02,885
is running and kind of hang out
and then, um, Going into October

579
00:31:58,895 --> 00:32:05,165
for Virtual Coffee, you know,
we'll, we'll, we'll have some,

580
00:32:02,885 --> 00:32:08,165
we'll have some more specific
events, uh, set up and some more

581
00:32:05,165 --> 00:32:09,905
things kind of, kind of go in
that we'll a little bit later.

582
00:32:09,935 --> 00:32:12,695
Um, in September, I guess,

583
00:32:13,171 --> 00:32:13,290
Bekah: Yeah.

584
00:32:13,296 --> 00:32:14,375
Dan: once we figured out what
they all are.

585
00:32:15,211 --> 00:32:17,310
Bekah: I think one of the cool
things too, about how

586
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:20,520
much we've grown in the last
year is that we have a lot

587
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:24,780
more maintainers with us year
than we did last year.

588
00:32:25,351 --> 00:32:28,411
who have their own projects or
who have jobs at open

589
00:32:28,411 --> 00:32:31,320
source, I'm working on open
source projects.

590
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,290
And so it's been great to kind
of see that evolution of like,

591
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,681
oh, look, they participated last
year and got their first PRS.

592
00:32:37,711 --> 00:32:43,040
And now they're like on, on
this. Open source project

593
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:44,631
in their company. And, you know,
they're, they

594
00:32:44,631 --> 00:32:47,810
bring with them that amazing
experience of like knowing

595
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:51,800
what that feels like and being
able to help new people.

596
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,951
And there's a lot of, um, great
projects and

597
00:32:54,951 --> 00:32:57,171
also really meaningful projects
out there too.

598
00:32:57,171 --> 00:33:01,191
So going to be really exciting
to see much the

599
00:33:01,191 --> 00:33:02,901
variety has grown as well.

600
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:07,211
Dan: Yeah, absolutely. That's a
great point. Um, and.

601
00:33:08,826 --> 00:33:11,526
Well, I guess adding onto that,
one of that, another thing that

602
00:33:11,526 --> 00:33:15,635
we have new this year for us is,
uh, some, some team, a team

603
00:33:15,635 --> 00:33:18,455
of people that are helping out,
um, actually run the events

604
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:20,976
and, you know, run, run these
challenges and stuff like

605
00:33:20,976 --> 00:33:24,516
that to our monthly challenge
team, um, especially it has

606
00:33:24,516 --> 00:33:29,046
been, has been kicking butt. Uh,
I've been helping to get

607
00:33:26,256 --> 00:33:32,256
this rolling in September and,
um, So I just want to shout

608
00:33:29,526 --> 00:33:33,965
out to, to everybody there too.
Um, because that's

609
00:33:32,736 --> 00:33:37,955
been really cool. It's been cool
to have like a

610
00:33:34,056 --> 00:33:41,135
sort of a larger, um, I dunno,
group of people to generate

611
00:33:37,955 --> 00:33:43,326
ideas, bounce ideas off of, and,
and you know, everything.

612
00:33:43,326 --> 00:33:45,336
So that's, that's really fun.
I'm excited about that.

613
00:33:45,925 --> 00:33:47,246
Bekah: year at this time, we
didn't, we hadn't

614
00:33:47,246 --> 00:33:49,286
started monthly challenges that
started in November.

615
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,431
Um, with our blog challenge. So
it's really cool too, to

616
00:33:52,371 --> 00:34:02,540
see like where we've almost made
that full circle of a

617
00:33:55,431 --> 00:34:08,201
year of monthly challenges and
then next month, we're just

618
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:09,431
going to know, the last couple
of months of having other

619
00:34:09,431 --> 00:34:12,940
people step up the game with
monthly challenge and, and

620
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:16,210
have things thought through has
been, you know, a really great

621
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:21,911
way to show how much support we
have from the community that

622
00:34:21,911 --> 00:34:25,181
allows us to do extra things and
things that are meaningful.

623
00:34:25,181 --> 00:34:28,210
And, you know, I, I got a
message from one of the members.

624
00:34:29,181 --> 00:34:34,161
Wait today is still August. So
we did healthy

625
00:34:30,951 --> 00:34:37,130
habits for healthy devs. And I
checked in with

626
00:34:34,581 --> 00:34:38,030
one of the members to see how
they were doing.

627
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:40,731
And they said, well, this
monthly challenge is getting me

628
00:34:40,731 --> 00:34:44,090
through this month because it's
requiring like, deliberately

629
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:49,041
thinking about my health and how
I can turn off work and how

630
00:34:49,041 --> 00:34:56,391
I can create healthy habits. And
I just thought, you know,

631
00:34:51,291 --> 00:35:01,655
what a wonderful example of how.
The work that our members

632
00:34:57,126 --> 00:35:06,485
provide to support us, goes to
support everybody and

633
00:35:02,376 --> 00:35:07,655
those meaningful moments make it
all worth it.

634
00:35:10,496 --> 00:35:17,126
Kirk: Yeah. I think part of what
makes

635
00:35:10,916 --> 00:35:18,775
this whole experience so good.
It is.

636
00:35:19,166 --> 00:35:24,085
mean, it's obviously a great
thing to work with to like

637
00:35:24,115 --> 00:35:28,865
provide an experience for them.
But it's also been a really

638
00:35:26,255 --> 00:35:32,465
cool to see people who have not
had the experience to

639
00:35:28,865 --> 00:35:34,925
maybe like provide the support
in many ways in this space,

640
00:35:32,556 --> 00:35:37,655
get a chance to do that. You
know, there's, there's so

641
00:35:35,405 --> 00:35:41,766
many folks now in the different
teams we have, sometimes I,

642
00:35:37,655 --> 00:35:44,615
hard for me to keep track of all
the different issues we

643
00:35:41,766 --> 00:35:46,596
have because we have all these
different channels where people

644
00:35:44,615 --> 00:35:49,085
are doing amazing things.
everyone's saying like, oh,

645
00:35:47,346 --> 00:35:50,016
this is the person that would
have done something like this.

646
00:35:50,016 --> 00:35:52,465
And they're doing such amazing
jobs. And.

647
00:35:53,255 --> 00:35:56,226
You know, I feel like a big, a
big part of what I like

648
00:35:56,226 --> 00:35:58,865
about Virtual Coffee is that
like, this is like, this is

649
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:02,945
no one's job, but also in the
sense that for a lot of

650
00:36:02,945 --> 00:36:07,626
us, it's the first time we were
trying to do something

651
00:36:07,806 --> 00:36:11,045
and all we really had was the
belief that we could do it.

652
00:36:11,405 --> 00:36:15,186
And like the belief that we can
get support if we needed to.

653
00:36:15,936 --> 00:36:20,405
And that to me has been, you
know, super empowering.

654
00:36:22,141 --> 00:36:26,431
Having a space where you can to
help other people and try

655
00:36:26,431 --> 00:36:29,521
and work with other people and
try and initiative where

656
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:34,411
you can feel comfortable with
making mistakes and having to

657
00:36:34,411 --> 00:36:38,331
do things over and not having to
be perfect on zoom or, you know,

658
00:36:38,371 --> 00:36:42,990
just that's, that's hard to find
sometimes in real life land,

659
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:45,990
like you feel like the work you
have to do everything perfectly.

660
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,320
sometimes even just like
interpersonal relationships.

661
00:36:51,146 --> 00:36:57,615
That feels really healthy. And
that feels almost like as

662
00:36:52,706 --> 00:37:01,036
important as like who were on
the receiving it, being able

663
00:36:57,615 --> 00:37:02,675
to help people on the giving end
has been really good.

664
00:37:02,896 --> 00:37:06,525
And I mean, the big discovery,
which I guess isn't really

665
00:37:06,525 --> 00:37:09,726
surprising in retrospect because
it like why people want to give

666
00:37:09,726 --> 00:37:12,465
back, they want to help, you
know, our communities here.

667
00:37:12,465 --> 00:37:14,505
Cause it's just like, oh, this
is just a nice space

668
00:37:14,505 --> 00:37:17,266
where I get to help folks out.
And, um,

669
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:24,869
Dan: Yeah. I mean, I love that I
was going

670
00:37:19,409 --> 00:37:27,389
to segue into some other stuff,
but do we have any final,

671
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:30,835
like Hacktoberfest thoughts? Um,
other than. We're excited.

672
00:37:31,489 --> 00:37:33,320
Bekah: Well, I just want to say
too, just looking

673
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:36,530
back at how much I've grown
personally in the last year,

674
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:41,889
learning from everybody. Um, Uh,
you know, as we're

675
00:37:38,269 --> 00:37:45,639
approaching this and we're doing
this event and all

676
00:37:41,889 --> 00:37:48,699
of these things, think last year
I things more in black

677
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:50,320
and white, like there was
success or there was failure.

678
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:53,619
And I think this year for me,
it's, it's not ever about that.

679
00:37:53,619 --> 00:37:55,780
It's about the growth. Am I
growing?

680
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:58,269
You know, what am I doing to
push myself forward and

681
00:37:58,269 --> 00:37:59,774
to support the other people?
think that's just a Testament

682
00:37:59,774 --> 00:38:01,279
to.

683
00:38:01,735 --> 00:38:05,695
The community that's here is
supporting everyone

684
00:38:05,695 --> 00:38:08,244
because it isn't, it it's not
success or failure.

685
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:12,505
We're all moving forward. We're
all growing and we're

686
00:38:09,534 --> 00:38:13,614
growing together, um, and
growing in different ways.

687
00:38:13,614 --> 00:38:20,394
And so I think that, I'm, I'm
very that we up August with

688
00:38:20,425 --> 00:38:24,355
healthy habits for healthy devs,
because it gives a much better

689
00:38:24,355 --> 00:38:29,844
perspective going into some
really, you know, event heavy.

690
00:38:30,918 --> 00:38:38,047
Dan: I think that's a good
point. I think you might be sub

691
00:38:33,257 --> 00:38:43,527
tweeting me right now, but I
make my own choices. Yeah.

692
00:38:43,527 --> 00:38:47,467
I I'll echo that. I mean, it's,
uh, this

693
00:38:44,498 --> 00:38:52,117
community is so great. And the,
the we've sort of

694
00:38:47,467 --> 00:38:55,717
naturally, uh, focused on, on
mental health, I think, um,

695
00:38:52,148 --> 00:38:57,907
from the beginning, you know,
without, without any, without

696
00:38:55,717 --> 00:39:00,628
any sort of decision, right. It
was a natural thing

697
00:38:57,907 --> 00:39:01,967
because, um, the people here.
Care.

698
00:39:02,057 --> 00:39:06,858
Um, you know, and we see over
and over again, uh, everybody

699
00:39:06,858 --> 00:39:09,827
knows and has experienced I'm
sure, uh, you know,

700
00:39:09,827 --> 00:39:12,858
burnout and, uh, overworking and
all of that stuff.

701
00:39:12,887 --> 00:39:18,047
Um, uh, the fact that our
community is a community of

702
00:39:18,047 --> 00:39:20,148
people who like, who care so
much about each other, that,

703
00:39:20,177 --> 00:39:23,148
you know, giving support for
that, uh, with mental

704
00:39:23,148 --> 00:39:25,128
health just kind of comes
naturally for everybody.

705
00:39:25,128 --> 00:39:29,748
And it, And especially, I, I w I
want to especially shout

706
00:39:29,748 --> 00:39:31,637
out to Kirk here, because this
is one of the things that,

707
00:39:31,637 --> 00:39:34,728
you know, that he injected into
all of our thought

708
00:39:34,728 --> 00:39:40,097
processes at the beginning. Um,
this is while we were

709
00:39:35,927 --> 00:39:42,588
maybe not practicing it, um,
this, you know, in this time

710
00:39:40,188 --> 00:39:45,588
of year, maybe September last
year, we were pulling

711
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:48,608
together a documentation and
resources and the website

712
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:53,273
for active professed and. And
Kirk's, I just love,

713
00:39:50,483 --> 00:39:54,222
I just loved Kirk's thoughts on
all of it.

714
00:39:54,222 --> 00:39:56,813
And, and the, the focus on the
mental health and the

715
00:39:56,813 --> 00:39:59,182
taking a break and the, you
know, all that stuff, it's,

716
00:39:59,213 --> 00:40:01,492
it can be easy to get, even with
volunteer stuff, it can

717
00:40:01,492 --> 00:40:05,612
be easy to get caught up. Um,
and, uh, and everything,

718
00:40:02,512 --> 00:40:07,463
you know, and like Bekah said,
the black and whiteness

719
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:10,697
of everything, you know, anyway,
the mental health

720
00:40:08,088 --> 00:40:12,197
focus of our, of our, um,
community is amazing.

721
00:40:12,197 --> 00:40:14,838
And I, never really put it
together like that, but I think

722
00:40:14,838 --> 00:40:17,657
that's a great point that August
was sort of a breather month

723
00:40:17,657 --> 00:40:19,547
that, you know, in a, in a
mental health check-in month.

724
00:40:19,637 --> 00:40:23,597
Um, and I don't know, it's a
good, it's a great thing to

725
00:40:23,597 --> 00:40:26,478
keep in mind, moving forward,
moving forward for of us.

726
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:31,157
Even if I'm not always going to
be good at doing what's that

727
00:40:32,023 --> 00:40:37,152
Kirk: Why Dan and Bekah not good
at taking breaks? No.

728
00:40:37,603 --> 00:40:38,862
Who would think that.

729
00:40:38,963 --> 00:40:39,773
Bekah: into this?

730
00:40:40,123 --> 00:40:41,472
Kirk: You, you would identify
with this?

731
00:40:41,503 --> 00:40:46,782
but don't think you're not here.
This podcast could

732
00:40:44,443 --> 00:40:48,373
be called like people with
letting go issues,

733
00:40:49,188 --> 00:40:49,547
Bekah: Yeah.

734
00:40:50,632 --> 00:40:53,932
Kirk: but it's okay. That's what
we have

735
00:40:52,043 --> 00:40:56,452
The community for to remind us
like it's it's okay.

736
00:40:56,597 --> 00:40:57,617
Bekah: frozen soundtrack.

737
00:40:57,889 --> 00:40:58,880
Kirk: Oh, I still haven't
watched it.

738
00:40:59,034 --> 00:40:59,815
Bekah: you said, let it go.

739
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:04,530
Kirk: I've never seen Frozen.
Not one or two.

740
00:41:05,505 --> 00:41:09,784
Heard good things. I'll wait for
the live action.

741
00:41:10,309 --> 00:41:16,760
Dan: Yeah. That's all right. Um,
so.

742
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:21,965
I, um, I think I said at the top
maybe, but this is the

743
00:41:21,965 --> 00:41:25,894
last episode of season three of
our podcast and we're kind

744
00:41:25,894 --> 00:41:33,755
of wrapping up and things. So I
wanted to, before we end

745
00:41:27,155 --> 00:41:35,764
this episode, um, I dunno, shout
out some, some different things

746
00:41:33,755 --> 00:41:37,594
that have happened over either
the last, you know, during

747
00:41:35,764 --> 00:41:39,875
the last season or the last, um,
year with Virtual Coffee.

748
00:41:40,385 --> 00:41:43,525
Um, so I guess first the, uh,
podcast  we

749
00:41:43,525 --> 00:41:48,684
passed 4,000 downloads. Um, but
you know, total for our

750
00:41:45,054 --> 00:41:51,235
podcasts, uh, a little bit ago.
And I just, I think

751
00:41:48,804 --> 00:41:53,005
that's amazing. And I wanted to,
say

752
00:41:51,235 --> 00:41:53,846
thank you to everybody who's
been listening.

753
00:41:53,936 --> 00:41:55,646
Uh, and everybody who's joined.

754
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:56,840
Bekah: on and told their story.

755
00:41:57,425 --> 00:42:02,235
Dan: Yes. Uh, included Kirk is,
uh,

756
00:41:58,445 --> 00:42:03,646
you know, repeat guest,  and,
um, yeah, it's really great.

757
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:05,706
It's, it's crazy that there's so
many people I've

758
00:42:05,715 --> 00:42:08,626
listened to, to our podcast. I
don't know.

759
00:42:08,806 --> 00:42:12,465
Um, it's hard to really
comprehend 4,000 people or

760
00:42:12,465 --> 00:42:14,865
4,000, you know, listens I
guess, or whatever.

761
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:17,655
But, um, I just, I dunno, I
wanted to shout that

762
00:42:17,655 --> 00:42:18,885
out and say, thank you.

763
00:42:19,766 --> 00:42:22,275
Kirk: Am I the first person to
repeat on the podcast.

764
00:42:22,768 --> 00:42:24,458
Dan: Yeah. Yeah, for sure. Yeah.

765
00:42:24,697 --> 00:42:25,358
Bekah: co-host

766
00:42:25,492 --> 00:42:25,913
Kirk: the Martin

767
00:42:25,958 --> 00:42:26,887
Bekah: or sometimes cohost.

768
00:42:28,043 --> 00:42:31,132
Kirk: the secret co-host only,
you only get access to me if

769
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:36,213
you listen to enough of it. So
if you're listening.

770
00:42:37,487 --> 00:42:41,288
Dan: Um, One thing Kirk said
earlier about, um, just the

771
00:42:41,288 --> 00:42:44,498
community kind of work together.
Made me think of the

772
00:42:42,248 --> 00:42:47,108
coworking room as well. Um, a
co-working

773
00:42:44,557 --> 00:42:51,367
room for anybody who is
listening, who doesn't

774
00:42:48,068 --> 00:42:53,527
know is a, uh, a room it's a
slack channel in a room

775
00:42:51,367 --> 00:42:57,248
in Virtual Coffee, psych that,
um, it's basically,

776
00:42:53,527 --> 00:43:02,137
and always on zoom meeting. And
so people can join the

777
00:42:57,398 --> 00:43:02,978
meeting and work together and
hang out together.

778
00:43:02,978 --> 00:43:06,458
Kirk, I think, like you visit
often. Do you want to

779
00:43:07,057 --> 00:43:07,268
come here?

780
00:43:07,762 --> 00:43:09,563
Kirk: live in the court. Uh,

781
00:43:09,668 --> 00:43:10,117
Dan: can you, can

782
00:43:10,168 --> 00:43:10,288
Bekah: Yeah.

783
00:43:10,358 --> 00:43:11,018
Dan: about it a little bit?

784
00:43:11,152 --> 00:43:13,193
Kirk: well, I mean, first I
think like the important thing

785
00:43:13,193 --> 00:43:16,702
is to say, shout out to Dan for
making the coworking room.

786
00:43:16,762 --> 00:43:18,202
Um, it,

787
00:43:18,307 --> 00:43:20,018
Dan: I don't know. We're
shouting out other

788
00:43:18,547 --> 00:43:20,018
people in this sector.

789
00:43:20,603 --> 00:43:23,663
Kirk: I, yeah, but like from
the, from the slack side,

790
00:43:23,663 --> 00:43:25,432
it looks like very simple. You
hit join again.

791
00:43:26,108 --> 00:43:29,228
But I know like you're doing
like several magics to get

792
00:43:29,228 --> 00:43:34,958
that all working smoothly. So, I
mean, you were sincerely

793
00:43:30,338 --> 00:43:38,617
rewarded for your efforts. I
think the folks that use the

794
00:43:34,958 --> 00:43:42,938
room really, really value it.
Um, for a lot of members, there

795
00:43:39,307 --> 00:43:44,737
are a couple of our members.
Sometimes it's difficult

796
00:43:42,938 --> 00:43:47,978
for them to get to regular
coffees, I've had warranty

797
00:43:44,737 --> 00:43:50,047
folks say, but I know I can
always jump in coworking

798
00:43:47,978 --> 00:43:52,327
and there's usually someone
there and sometimes that's my

799
00:43:50,047 --> 00:43:54,188
Virtual Coffee for the week. Uh,
so that's really good.

800
00:43:55,012 --> 00:44:00,472
And, you know, it's, it's just
become, it's just another

801
00:44:00,563 --> 00:44:03,472
space, another platform for VC
members to interact with each

802
00:44:03,472 --> 00:44:08,512
other and provide support. Uh,
sometimes people will

803
00:44:06,052 --> 00:44:10,643
have questions and helping
pairing, and they're like,

804
00:44:08,512 --> 00:44:12,773
Hey, you know, if no one's in
the co-working room, jump in.

805
00:44:12,773 --> 00:44:17,152
Or, and then the coworking room
becomes like a little and learn

806
00:44:17,152 --> 00:44:20,782
session where, know, everyone's
just like, trying to help the

807
00:44:20,782 --> 00:44:22,882
person do the problem, but also
watching people kind of

808
00:44:22,882 --> 00:44:26,887
pair up and go through school.
So it's, it's got a lot of

809
00:44:24,427 --> 00:44:31,297
purposes, but it's, it's
definitely I know the members

810
00:44:26,887 --> 00:44:36,077
really appreciate really enjoy.
Um, shout out also to Meg, who

811
00:44:31,898 --> 00:44:42,637
I think also there's a lot of
work in there and, um, Yeah,

812
00:44:36,728 --> 00:44:45,108
it's, I think it quickly rose up
the ranks to become like

813
00:44:42,637 --> 00:44:49,838
one of the coolest parts of VC
who had coworking helping

814
00:44:45,108 --> 00:44:49,838
pairing just like a, this is.

815
00:44:51,253 --> 00:44:55,092
Dan: Yeah, the and I feel  like
they kind of are almost, uh,

816
00:44:55,782 --> 00:44:57,282
you had to work together, right?
Help and pairing.

817
00:44:57,742 --> 00:45:00,402
have a help and pairing channel,
you know, Just

818
00:45:00,402 --> 00:45:02,922
very often, see somebody asks a
question and somebody

819
00:45:02,922 --> 00:45:05,563
answered, Hey, I have a minute.
Let's jump into

820
00:45:03,882 --> 00:45:07,333
the coworking room. Um, which is
amazing.

821
00:45:07,873 --> 00:45:13,092
I, uh, we were going to add our,
like the, to our newsletter.

822
00:45:13,092 --> 00:45:16,422
We're going to add the longest
meeting of the month or longest,

823
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:18,402
and not meeting with the
longest, uh, coworking session.

824
00:45:18,402 --> 00:45:21,313
Right. So can last, you know,
somebody starts a session.

825
00:45:21,313 --> 00:45:23,143
The session lasts until the last
person leaves. Right.

826
00:45:23,143 --> 00:45:24,913
So it doesn't necessarily have
to be that person

827
00:45:24,913 --> 00:45:27,103
staying on the whole time.
Right. And so.

828
00:45:27,898 --> 00:45:30,628
Uh, subscribe to your newsletter
if you want to see it the

829
00:45:30,688 --> 00:45:34,197
longest and August, but I, that
made me want to look it up what

830
00:45:34,197 --> 00:45:40,677
the historical longest one. And
so it was, um, 789

831
00:45:35,157 --> 00:45:41,967
minutes, um, on, on the, at the,
end of July, July 24th.

832
00:45:42,447 --> 00:45:46,728
Um, so that, you know, I mean,
that's, whatever

833
00:45:46,728 --> 00:45:47,628
it is, I did this

834
00:45:47,777 --> 00:45:49,307
Kirk: No, don't go for it to
hours.

835
00:45:49,338 --> 00:45:52,338
It doesn't sound as cool. Okay.
So it sounds pretty cool.

836
00:45:52,422 --> 00:45:57,132
Dan: hours and, uh, yeah. Yeah.
That's, uh, it's, uh,

837
00:45:54,793 --> 00:46:00,163
it, it's pretty cool. And it's
just cool that

838
00:45:57,132 --> 00:46:01,753
somebody, like some of our
friends were just

839
00:46:00,163 --> 00:46:02,382
hanging out for that long. You
know what I mean?

840
00:46:02,532 --> 00:46:06,432
Um, I love it. We, we have, I
don't know,

841
00:46:03,643 --> 00:46:07,693
almost 350 sessions have
happened since we started it.

842
00:46:09,268 --> 00:46:11,097
February, maybe they're at the
beginning of the year.

843
00:46:11,128 --> 00:46:16,197
Um, and, uh, it's been cool. So
if you are a member and

844
00:46:13,498 --> 00:46:16,947
haven't checked it out, go ahead
and check it out.

845
00:46:17,038 --> 00:46:19,588
And, uh, if you aren't a Virtual
Coffee member,

846
00:46:19,588 --> 00:46:22,438
this is just one of the many
things you're missing.

847
00:46:25,077 --> 00:46:29,608
Um, the, what else? We got
podcast as

848
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:33,657
room sponsorships. Bekah, do you
wanna tell

849
00:46:32,188 --> 00:46:33,657
us about sponsorships?

850
00:46:33,938 --> 00:46:35,588
Bekah: Sure. I'll tell you about
sponsorships.

851
00:46:36,097 --> 00:46:40,027
Um, so you can sponsor Virtual
Coffee, help us keep the

852
00:46:40,027 --> 00:46:45,668
coffee brewing, um, on GitHub.
I'll have a link in the show

853
00:46:42,338 --> 00:46:50,128
notes for that, but if you just
go to GitHub.com/Virtual-Coffee.

854
00:46:50,487 --> 00:46:52,887
There'll be a little heart
sponsor button and there's

855
00:46:52,887 --> 00:46:57,268
different tiers there for
different ways that you can,

856
00:46:57,327 --> 00:47:02,697
um, contribute, um, to Virtual
Coffee, to make sure that we

857
00:47:02,697 --> 00:47:06,358
can cover some of the costs that
are, that, that are

858
00:47:06,358 --> 00:47:10,677
incurred to run Virtual Coffee.
And I think maybe we'll.

859
00:47:11,458 --> 00:47:14,697
Put something up there. We'll be
talking

860
00:47:12,898 --> 00:47:16,168
more about having a
Hacktoberfest sponsor too.

861
00:47:16,168 --> 00:47:19,228
So if you're listening to this
and you know, somebody who'd be

862
00:47:19,228 --> 00:47:26,458
interested and sponsoring all of
our fun, please just reach out

863
00:47:26,458 --> 00:47:28,788
to us at hello@virtualcoffee.io.

864
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:34,137
Dan: Yep. Um, we have, we have
on our home on a, on like

865
00:47:34,137 --> 00:47:38,668
on our website website. Um, we
have a section

866
00:47:36,407 --> 00:47:42,327
of our sponsors too. So you can
see who has supported

867
00:47:38,668 --> 00:47:45,818
us so far that we have like 26,
26 sponsors, um, and I want

868
00:47:42,327 --> 00:47:47,047
to say thank you to everybody
who has sponsored us so far.

869
00:47:48,128 --> 00:47:51,608
Well, um, yeah. So is there
anything else

870
00:47:49,027 --> 00:47:52,597
we wanted to, we wanted to cover
before we wrap up.

871
00:47:53,202 --> 00:47:55,393
Bekah: I just want to say thank
you to everybody that has

872
00:47:55,393 --> 00:48:00,672
donated their time and their
effort, um, resources to making

873
00:48:00,672 --> 00:48:03,733
sure that everybody has been
supported over the last year

874
00:48:03,733 --> 00:48:09,943
that we've been doing this. You
know, it's still an amazing

875
00:48:05,172 --> 00:48:15,583
thing in my mind that here we
are a year later, closer and

876
00:48:09,943 --> 00:48:17,503
together and grown so much. And
we're able to do this again.

877
00:48:17,503 --> 00:48:21,043
So you for everyone for making
sure that that

878
00:48:21,043 --> 00:48:21,702
got to happen, right.

879
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:30,041
Kirk: Yeah. I think, um, I just
want to

880
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:31,905
say I, I, I still get a lot of.
I don't know.

881
00:48:31,905 --> 00:48:34,706
I still, a lot of people ask me
like, Hey, you know, what

882
00:48:34,706 --> 00:48:38,275
happens when VC gets too big? Or
what are we going to

883
00:48:36,326 --> 00:48:41,996
do when PC gets super big? And
I'm like, well, I mean,

884
00:48:38,275 --> 00:48:48,206
you know, every community has
growing pains, I think what

885
00:48:41,996 --> 00:48:53,755
makes me feel really happy and,
um, really positive is no,

886
00:48:48,266 --> 00:48:58,615
every, every time I come into
VC, I still see people being

887
00:48:53,755 --> 00:49:01,346
really, uh, warm and caring. I
still see people

888
00:48:59,576 --> 00:49:02,246
supporting each other and the
heavy channel.

889
00:49:02,666 --> 00:49:05,275
I still see people supporting
each other and helping pairing.

890
00:49:05,786 --> 00:49:07,976
And I think the cool thing is
there's a lot of

891
00:49:07,976 --> 00:49:11,525
folks who have been here since
last Hacktoberfest.

892
00:49:11,545 --> 00:49:14,306
You know, you have folks who
have been here for

893
00:49:12,146 --> 00:49:17,666
over a year with us, and that's
amazing, but we also have a lot

894
00:49:14,306 --> 00:49:22,045
of new folks, know, folks with
been here a month, two months,

895
00:49:17,666 --> 00:49:26,501
three months, and they are.
Enjoying it, loving it and

896
00:49:23,291 --> 00:49:29,411
then making new friendships and
supporting other people and

897
00:49:26,561 --> 00:49:33,460
being supportive themselves. And
I don't know that just,

898
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:35,650
it just always makes me, me feel
really good every time

899
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:39,380
I see someone who hasn't been
here that long, but when we

900
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:41,920
do our Friday gratitude or
Wednesday shout outs, like,

901
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:45,460
Hey, I really liked this space.
And I really liked the people

902
00:49:41,951 --> 00:49:47,530
here and I want to help out.
And, um, that makes me

903
00:49:45,641 --> 00:49:48,400
think that, you know, they're
still doing that.

904
00:49:49,447 --> 00:49:52,777
Dan: Yeah, I would, uh, I, I
would just echo both

905
00:49:53,137 --> 00:49:58,358
what you've all said. You know,
this community is

906
00:49:54,188 --> 00:49:59,257
amazing and I'm very glad and
proud to be part of it.

907
00:49:59,858 --> 00:50:03,547
And the members. What makes you
know,

908
00:50:01,628 --> 00:50:05,047
what make it amazing. And, um, I
don't know.

909
00:50:05,047 --> 00:50:05,978
I'm looking forward to another
year.

910
00:50:05,978 --> 00:50:08,947
I, I am very, very pumped about
Hacktoberfest this year.

911
00:50:09,007 --> 00:50:11,197
I'm very pumped about the things
we have going on.

912
00:50:11,588 --> 00:50:16,268
The people that are going to be
involved I've yet

913
00:50:16,268 --> 00:50:19,478
to brew up exactly how I'm going
to, you know, try to.

914
00:50:20,273 --> 00:50:23,842
Murder myself at the end of the
month, trying to redo

915
00:50:23,842 --> 00:50:25,132
something, but I'm sure I'll
think of something.

916
00:50:25,463 --> 00:50:27,532
And I'm pumped about that to you
honestly, because there

917
00:50:27,532 --> 00:50:32,092
was a lot of fun last year. Um,
so yeah, I guess, I

918
00:50:28,913 --> 00:50:35,123
guess that's pretty much it. Um,
