00:00:07,772 --> 00:00:12,632
Bekah: Hello and welcome to
Season seven, episode two of the

2
00:00:12,632 --> 00:00:18,621
Virtual Coffee Podcast. I'm
Bekah, and this is a podcast that

3
00:00:18,621 --> 00:00:22,492
features members of the virtual
coffee community. Virtual Coffee

4
00:00:22,496 --> 00:00:26,001
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of their

5
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:28,882
coding journey, and they're here
on this podcast sharing their

6
00:00:28,887 --> 00:00:32,301
stories and what they've learned,
and we are here to share it with

7
00:00:32,301 --> 00:00:35,572
you. Here with me today is my
co-host Dan.

8
00:00:36,087 --> 00:00:37,777
Dan: What up Beck? How's it
going?

9
00:00:37,981 --> 00:00:38,710
Bekah: It's going.

10
00:00:38,935 --> 00:00:44,360
Dan: good. Um, hi. Yeah, we have
an awesome episode for y'all

11
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,850
today. Uh, we're talking to Joe
Karow. Joe's been a member for a

12
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,180
while and he's been pretty
involved in the community. Um,

13
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:55,170
and he's, he's a really great guy
and we had a lot of fun talking

14
00:00:55,176 --> 00:00:58,801
with him. Joe has been an active
volunteer for a while. He's done

15
00:00:58,805 --> 00:01:01,801
things like run our JavaScript
coffee table group. He's appeared

16
00:01:01,801 --> 00:01:05,040
on TypeScript Tuesdays, and he's
been a really active open source

17
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,254
contributor for our virtual
coffee projects. So today we're

18
00:01:08,254 --> 00:01:12,064
talking with Joe about, uh,
career transitions and also his

19
00:01:12,064 --> 00:01:15,075
experience with ADHD, in his tech
career. And it was a really good

20
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:15,674
conversation.

21
00:01:16,665 --> 00:01:19,875
Bekah: Yeah, it's always great to
hear a good transition story. Joe

22
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:22,484
used to be in hotel management,
so there's some skills he was

23
00:01:22,484 --> 00:01:25,545
able to bring over from there.
But to be able to kind of compare

24
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:30,344
those experiences and see Joe in
a position that seems to really

25
00:01:30,344 --> 00:01:32,954
fit his skillset in the things
that he's interested in.

26
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,188
Dan: Yeah, absolutely.

27
00:01:34,507 --> 00:01:37,477
Bekah: We start every episode of
the podcast, like we start every

28
00:01:37,477 --> 00:01:40,447
virtual coffee. We introduce
ourselves with our name, where

29
00:01:40,447 --> 00:01:45,441
we're from, what we do, and a
random check-in question. Today's

30
00:01:45,441 --> 00:01:50,542
question is, would you rather go
to a waterpark or an amusement

31
00:01:50,542 --> 00:02:01,959
park? We hope you enjoy this
episode. My name is Bekah. I am a

32
00:02:01,963 --> 00:02:08,079
technical community builder from
a small town in Ohio, and I would

33
00:02:08,348 --> 00:02:12,729
prefer to go to an amusement
park, which is ironic because I

34
00:02:12,729 --> 00:02:16,149
will be at a waterpark next week.

35
00:02:16,808 --> 00:02:17,929
Dan: Which waterpark

36
00:02:18,498 --> 00:02:20,519
Bekah: Kalahari in Austin giving
a talk.

37
00:02:20,615 --> 00:02:21,205
Dan: At Kalahari?

38
00:02:21,592 --> 00:02:24,201
Bekah: Mm-hmm. Yeah. At the top
of the water slide. I think

39
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,689
Dan: Best technique for, you
know, maximum

40
00:02:27,854 --> 00:02:30,074
Bekah: where they put the
keynotes. You're like at the top

41
00:02:30,074 --> 00:02:33,375
slide. And then if you are not
doing a keynote, then you have to

42
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:34,995
go to like the lower

43
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:36,360
Dan: Oh man.

44
00:02:36,974 --> 00:02:39,475
Joe: Yeah, and the whole slide
down is, it's a metaphor for

45
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:39,645
something.

46
00:02:40,905 --> 00:02:41,724
Bekah: Yeah, exactly.

47
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:47,669
Dan: Um, all right. Well, hi. I
am Dan. I, uh, live in Cleveland.

48
00:02:47,729 --> 00:02:53,069
I do computer thingies and, uh,
what is the question? Oh, um,

49
00:02:53,729 --> 00:02:56,939
yeah, I would say I don't really,
I'm not a huge fan of either,

50
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:59,789
honestly. I don't really like
large crowds of people, and I

51
00:02:59,789 --> 00:03:02,969
definitely don't like standing in
lines. Um, but I think I would

52
00:03:02,969 --> 00:03:08,835
say the amusement park. My sense
is that the food will be better.

53
00:03:09,344 --> 00:03:12,435
That's gonna be my, that's gonna
be my, like my main, you know,

54
00:03:13,004 --> 00:03:16,604
like a get like a really good,
you know, corn dog, like a, you

55
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:19,305
know, like a funnel cake. Yeah,
yeah. Like all that, all the

56
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:19,905
fried stuff, you

57
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:22,379
Bekah: Have you had one of those
funnel cakes that has like ice

58
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:24,180
cream and whipped cream and
strawberries on top?

59
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:28,266
Dan: I don't think so. But that
sounds good. And now I shall find

60
00:03:28,266 --> 00:03:31,896
one we used to go to, um, before
our covid and stuff, we'd go to

61
00:03:31,896 --> 00:03:34,657
Octoberfest here at Cleveland,
like at the fairgrounds every

62
00:03:34,657 --> 00:03:37,567
year. And that would be our, that
would be like our fried food, you

63
00:03:37,567 --> 00:03:41,016
know, fix like final cake and
corn dogs and stuff. And also

64
00:03:41,016 --> 00:03:43,870
beer, you know, it was just, it's
like the perfect combination. But

65
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,310
yeah, amusement park would be my.

66
00:03:46,176 --> 00:03:48,956
Joe: All right. And I'm Joe
Karow. Um, I'm the lead engineer

67
00:03:48,961 --> 00:03:53,486
at a small nonprofit, um, and I'm
based in the Washington DC metro

68
00:03:53,486 --> 00:03:58,317
area. As far as the question
goes, I'd probably go also for

69
00:03:58,317 --> 00:04:03,236
amusement park. Um, I don't know,
like, again, I'm, I'm also not a

70
00:04:03,236 --> 00:04:06,717
fan of large crowds, so if I'm
gonna be miserable, I'd rather

71
00:04:06,717 --> 00:04:10,812
not be damp and m. I'll go for
dry and miserable

72
00:04:11,306 --> 00:04:11,576
Dan: Yes.

73
00:04:12,942 --> 00:04:13,981
Bekah: Dry and miserable.

74
00:04:14,486 --> 00:04:16,617
Dan: Yeah. Dry, miserable. Yeah,
no, that occurred to me. Yeah,

75
00:04:16,617 --> 00:04:18,896
that was one of my things.
Waiting in line if you're, if

76
00:04:18,896 --> 00:04:20,937
you're gonna be waiting in line
rather be dry. Yes.

77
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:24,971
Joe: Yeah. I also, I, I got my,
my fix of all those, cuz like, I

78
00:04:24,971 --> 00:04:29,802
grew up, uh, in Tampa, Florida.
So the default school trip for

79
00:04:29,891 --> 00:04:35,232
anything was Busch Gardens. Um, I
can't, I think it was, it was one

80
00:04:35,461 --> 00:04:38,112
of the, I think it was like my
sophomore year in high. just

81
00:04:38,112 --> 00:04:42,132
based off of like, you know,
different departments like that.

82
00:04:42,132 --> 00:04:45,221
I think I went to Bush Garden six
times in the same year for school

83
00:04:45,221 --> 00:04:45,762
trips.

84
00:04:45,956 --> 00:04:46,526
Bekah: Oh my gosh.

85
00:04:46,841 --> 00:04:47,262
Joe: Yeah.

86
00:04:49,427 --> 00:04:52,396
Dan: Yeah, we, we did a lot of,
that's, that's impressive. Six

87
00:04:52,396 --> 00:04:52,786
times is

88
00:04:52,976 --> 00:04:54,476
Bekah: Did you do a Cedar Point,
Dan?

89
00:04:54,706 --> 00:04:57,257
Dan: Yeah. Yeah. A lot of Cedar
Point. Yeah. Was there a lot of

90
00:04:57,262 --> 00:05:01,786
times as a, you know, as a kid
last time, I think the last time

91
00:05:01,786 --> 00:05:03,826
I was there, I got really bad
food poisoning. It was like a

92
00:05:03,826 --> 00:05:05,596
field trip. My dad had to come
pick me up and stuff.

93
00:05:05,617 --> 00:05:05,966
Bekah: Oh,

94
00:05:06,286 --> 00:05:10,096
Dan: So it, uh, I, I refused to
try to think about which food,

95
00:05:10,247 --> 00:05:14,622
what caused it, you know. I've
had, I haven't, I don't think

96
00:05:14,622 --> 00:05:16,841
I've, I haven't not been back to
Cedar Point because of that, you

97
00:05:16,841 --> 00:05:19,482
know, like I would, I would go
again, but yeah, it was, it was

98
00:05:19,482 --> 00:05:20,081
not that fun.

99
00:05:21,206 --> 00:05:23,906
Bekah: We had Kennywood, so
that's in Pittsburgh.

100
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,951
Dan: Oh yeah. I've driven past
there.

101
00:05:27,447 --> 00:05:29,997
Bekah: I used to love the
rollercoasters, like back in the

102
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:33,146
day when I was younger and now
having kids and like doing roller

103
00:05:33,151 --> 00:05:35,666
coasters with them. I find them
very terrifying.

104
00:05:37,076 --> 00:05:40,031
Joe: Well, awesome. So now like.
We're older, we get back and neck

105
00:05:40,031 --> 00:05:40,692
problems

106
00:05:41,846 --> 00:05:46,406
Bekah: Yeah. Alright, so I think
the, the takeaway from this is we

107
00:05:46,406 --> 00:05:54,132
are all boring Don't go to the
amusement park with

108
00:05:54,341 --> 00:05:57,072
Dan: We would rather be dry and
boring than damp and boring.

109
00:05:57,492 --> 00:06:00,252
Joe: right? And one of us will
hold your bags.

110
00:06:04,211 --> 00:06:07,841
Bekah: Um, welcome Joe. It is
good to have you here on the

111
00:06:07,846 --> 00:06:12,192
podcast. Uh, we always like to
start off with your origin story,

112
00:06:12,252 --> 00:06:17,232
uh, but first I have asked you to
choose one word to describe your

113
00:06:17,232 --> 00:06:19,362
developer journey. So let's get
started with.

114
00:06:20,055 --> 00:06:23,391
Joe: I dunno. It's somewhere
between chaotic and good. I

115
00:06:23,391 --> 00:06:24,531
didn't really expect to kind of

116
00:06:24,637 --> 00:06:25,266
Bekah: wracking is

117
00:06:25,341 --> 00:06:30,562
Joe: nerve wracking. There we go.
Yes. Um, I didn't really kind of

118
00:06:31,612 --> 00:06:37,612
aim to be a career changer. It
just kind of happened. Um, uh,

119
00:06:37,641 --> 00:06:41,992
because prior to this I was in
the hospitality industry. Um, you

120
00:06:41,992 --> 00:06:45,471
know, kind of wore several hats
in that. So I started off doing

121
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:49,401
front desk, which is like people,
people, people all the time, you

122
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:53,257
know, you're there to solve
everybody's problem. And then I

123
00:06:53,257 --> 00:06:56,377
moved over to finance and kind of
worked my way up, you know,

124
00:06:56,437 --> 00:06:59,466
through the ranks of that. And I
was still just solving everyone's

125
00:06:59,466 --> 00:07:02,646
problems, but it was just
internal ones. Uh, but with Covid

126
00:07:02,646 --> 00:07:06,937
it just, the industry just went
into disarray and it was just, it

127
00:07:06,937 --> 00:07:11,706
was not enjoyable anymore. So,
um, I had, I had decided to take

128
00:07:11,706 --> 00:07:16,747
a break, um, and then at that
point I was like, Hmm, what do I

129
00:07:16,747 --> 00:07:20,137
want to be when I grow? you know,
and it's always fun asking

130
00:07:20,137 --> 00:07:26,947
yourself that question, you know,
at the age of like 37 Um, and it

131
00:07:26,951 --> 00:07:30,966
was just something where I, I
kind of started looking, you

132
00:07:30,966 --> 00:07:33,906
know, into web development. Uh,
cuz it, I've always messed around

133
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:39,276
with technology. Uh, I actually
did web development, like when I

134
00:07:39,276 --> 00:07:43,687
was like high school, middle
school, um, like literally back,

135
00:07:43,747 --> 00:07:46,747
I actually found one of my old
websites, which is somehow still.

136
00:07:47,391 --> 00:07:48,862
From 1999.

137
00:07:49,987 --> 00:07:52,867
Bekah: We would like a link to
include in the show notes.

138
00:07:52,971 --> 00:07:57,591
Joe: never gonna happen. Never
gonna happen. Uh, but I'll tell

139
00:07:57,591 --> 00:08:00,711
you right now, when that, when
that site meant free hosting for

140
00:08:00,711 --> 00:08:01,552
life, they meant it

141
00:08:04,252 --> 00:08:05,601
Dan: Yeah. That's impressive.
That's awesome.

142
00:08:07,762 --> 00:08:11,632
Joe: But yeah, so, um, I, you
know, I kind of said along what

143
00:08:11,632 --> 00:08:13,492
Vil meant. It was, you know, I
kind of talked it over with

144
00:08:13,497 --> 00:08:17,812
family when I went, I went back,
uh, for holidays. You know, chat

145
00:08:17,812 --> 00:08:21,502
with them and came back in
January and I was like literally

146
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:24,771
getting ready to like pull a
trigger on doing one of those

147
00:08:24,862 --> 00:08:30,021
multi-thousand dollars boot
camps. And I stumbled upon um, a

148
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:35,662
Reddit post for uh, 100 devs and
I was like, well, let me try this

149
00:08:35,662 --> 00:08:39,172
first before I go. And I, you
know, commit to money I don't

150
00:08:39,172 --> 00:08:42,442
have, cuz I figure if it doesn't
work out, the only thing I've

151
00:08:42,442 --> 00:08:48,547
wasted is time. And that was the
one thing I had plenty of So,

152
00:08:48,547 --> 00:08:51,667
yeah, going through that it was,
you know, it was, it was really,

153
00:08:51,817 --> 00:08:55,177
well, you know, the way it was
done. Um, and the, I think the

154
00:08:55,177 --> 00:09:00,216
biggest part about doing that
versus doing like the whole kind

155
00:09:00,216 --> 00:09:03,307
of free code Camp Oden project
thing is having that community

156
00:09:03,307 --> 00:09:06,576
around you. Because when you're
just there by yourself, you're

157
00:09:06,576 --> 00:09:09,246
like, it's really what I'm
supposed to be doing, you know?

158
00:09:09,246 --> 00:09:11,527
And you don't really have anyone
kind of like holding you

159
00:09:11,527 --> 00:09:15,201
accountable or. in the trenches
of misery with you whenever you

160
00:09:15,201 --> 00:09:18,351
just can't figure something out.
So at least you can, you know,

161
00:09:18,351 --> 00:09:21,052
kind of be like, oh, well I'm not
the only one who can't figure

162
00:09:21,057 --> 00:09:25,902
this out. So it's not just me.
And then I, I happened upon this

163
00:09:25,902 --> 00:09:32,101
job and I've been, um, working
here for, since about Labor Day,

164
00:09:32,106 --> 00:09:36,672
so going on like a little over
four months now. And I love it.

165
00:09:36,792 --> 00:09:42,023
Nonprofit life. It's, it's, slow.
It is laid back. Everyone is

166
00:09:42,028 --> 00:09:45,731
super nice. So it's like a really
big change from like the chaotic

167
00:09:45,731 --> 00:09:48,461
world of hotels where everyone's
like, I need this and I need this

168
00:09:48,466 --> 00:09:49,152
now.

169
00:09:50,547 --> 00:09:51,116
Bekah: Yeah.

170
00:09:51,192 --> 00:09:51,971
Joe: yeah, we'll get to it.

171
00:09:52,797 --> 00:09:55,736
Bekah: That's really nice and I
really appreciate the thing that

172
00:09:55,736 --> 00:09:58,886
you were saying about learning
with a community of people and

173
00:09:58,886 --> 00:10:01,527
not feeling like, oh, I'm the
only one that doesn't know this.

174
00:10:01,527 --> 00:10:04,317
Like the ability just to know
that you are not the only one

175
00:10:04,317 --> 00:10:08,096
that doesn't get it is somehow
really motivating in a lot of

176
00:10:08,101 --> 00:10:08,846
different ways.

177
00:10:10,601 --> 00:10:13,991
Joe: Yeah, and this is probably
not gonna sound right, but like

178
00:10:13,991 --> 00:10:16,331
it's always nice to kind of,
sometimes you go and you're

179
00:10:16,331 --> 00:10:19,091
seeing like how other people are
struggling. You're like, well, at

180
00:10:19,091 --> 00:10:20,052
least I'm not there.

181
00:10:20,261 --> 00:10:20,532
Bekah: Yeah.

182
00:10:22,902 --> 00:10:24,091
Joe: I'm doing better than
someone.

183
00:10:24,912 --> 00:10:28,032
Bekah: Yeah, it, no, I think like
all of us have kind of had that

184
00:10:28,032 --> 00:10:31,062
feeling too, though. Especially
when you're really struggling a

185
00:10:31,067 --> 00:10:34,721
lot and you're like, okay, I
know. I know I shouldn't take joy

186
00:10:34,932 --> 00:10:38,381
in this, but this is what I need
to motivate me right now.

187
00:10:38,511 --> 00:10:40,761
Joe: It's kind of like, you know,
watching Hoarders, we're like,

188
00:10:40,782 --> 00:10:42,841
all right, my house really isn't
that bad,

189
00:10:44,695 --> 00:10:47,934
Bekah: Um, I wanna jump back to
your word to describe your

190
00:10:47,934 --> 00:10:51,054
journey a little bit more and see
if we could dive into that a

191
00:10:51,054 --> 00:10:55,794
little bit. So, nerve wracking,
right? So as you're going through

192
00:10:55,794 --> 00:11:00,384
this developer journey, this
learning process, and, you know,

193
00:11:00,384 --> 00:11:04,705
as a career changer and somebody
who's not doing it in their early

194
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:08,004
twenties, how do you think that
that kind of like impacted that

195
00:11:08,004 --> 00:11:11,605
journey and how were you able to
get through it when it felt so

196
00:11:11,605 --> 00:11:13,524
nerve-wracking or chaotic?

197
00:11:14,955 --> 00:11:19,225
Joe: I think the biggest thing
was going to be like anticipating

198
00:11:19,225 --> 00:11:23,394
the imposter syndrome because
I've already experienced it, like

199
00:11:24,325 --> 00:11:27,414
with other roles, you know, like
especially right around like kind

200
00:11:27,414 --> 00:11:30,264
of promotion time and you're like
sitting in your new office and

201
00:11:30,264 --> 00:11:32,815
you're like, man, I wonder how
long it's gonna take for them to

202
00:11:32,815 --> 00:11:36,865
realize that they've made a
massive mistake by doing this. So

203
00:11:36,865 --> 00:11:40,075
I think it was just kind of like
nerve wracking of like, you know,

204
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:43,855
anticipating that imposter
syndrome. Cause I knew, I knew it

205
00:11:43,855 --> 00:11:47,004
was gonna come, whatever job I
had landed at that, at that

206
00:11:47,004 --> 00:11:52,674
point. But it was also just kind
of like, um, you know, cause I, I

207
00:11:52,674 --> 00:11:56,695
essentially was out of work for a
year and I, I, I had a bit of a,

208
00:11:57,384 --> 00:12:00,174
a monetary buffer going into it.
But, you know, watching that

209
00:12:00,174 --> 00:12:06,835
dwindle is also never really fun.
So I managed to, Luckily get the

210
00:12:06,835 --> 00:12:08,725
job right around the same point
where I was like, all right,

211
00:12:08,725 --> 00:12:12,534
things are getting kind of tight
right now. Um, so it was just

212
00:12:12,534 --> 00:12:17,184
kind of like, just nerve-wracking
of life of like, am I gonna, you

213
00:12:17,184 --> 00:12:19,884
know, is this all gonna work out
in the end? Like I don't wanna

214
00:12:19,884 --> 00:12:22,945
have to like, you know, start
selling plasma or something.

215
00:12:25,855 --> 00:12:29,215
Bekah: Yeah, that's really hard.
And I imagine that going into the

216
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:34,585
interview process, that made it
even more nerve wracking because

217
00:12:34,764 --> 00:12:38,455
you're, you're watching that bank
account go down. and you know

218
00:12:38,455 --> 00:12:42,534
that there's a time period where
you're gonna have to make a hard

219
00:12:42,534 --> 00:12:48,745
decision potentially. So how did
that impact how you interviewed,

220
00:12:48,955 --> 00:12:52,585
where you applied in that whole
job application process?

221
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:59,740
Joe: so. I got really lucky. I'm
just gonna say that flat out. I

222
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:03,399
got incredibly lucky. Um, because
the way that I actually came

223
00:13:03,404 --> 00:13:08,110
across this job was, um, I had
stumbled across this job board

224
00:13:08,139 --> 00:13:14,500
where they only list like
nonprofits, public benefit

225
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:18,159
corporations. It's like, you
know, companies who do good. Um,

226
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,919
and you could, you know, you
could submit your resume to their

227
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:23,529
talent pool and you could also
like look at all their listing.

228
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:27,565
So I did that, forgot I did it
for like a month and a half, and

229
00:13:27,565 --> 00:13:31,134
all of a sudden get this email
from this job board saying, Hey,

230
00:13:31,164 --> 00:13:34,164
um, this, you know, this company
would like to meet you. Here's an

231
00:13:34,164 --> 00:13:39,654
introduction. Um, and that's
where I work now, so I only

232
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:47,634
interviewed once. Um, so I, it,
you know, and it just, And to be

233
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:51,355
like, you know, I was thinking
like, okay, well maybe I can kind

234
00:13:51,355 --> 00:13:53,605
of take this offer and like, you
know, shop around other places.

235
00:13:53,605 --> 00:14:00,565
But between, you know, what the,
the, you know, the, the product

236
00:14:00,565 --> 00:14:04,554
was and the team and the mission.
I was like, no, this is, this is

237
00:14:04,554 --> 00:14:09,504
work. This is where I belong. You
know, and it it, that's the other

238
00:14:09,504 --> 00:14:11,605
thing about working for a
nonprofit is not only is it like

239
00:14:11,605 --> 00:14:15,955
super laid back and everyone is
really nice, um, you also, you

240
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:19,284
get that satisfaction like, you
know, I'm, I'm doing something

241
00:14:19,284 --> 00:14:21,115
that's, that's benefiting others.

242
00:14:21,447 --> 00:14:25,457
Bekah: Joe, Do you know, do you
know the name of the job board

243
00:14:25,457 --> 00:14:28,567
that you use just in case we can
share that out with other folks?

244
00:14:29,538 --> 00:14:34,128
Joe: um, I believe it was all
hands. I can, I can give you a, a

245
00:14:34,128 --> 00:14:35,628
link for it in the, for the show.

246
00:14:36,378 --> 00:14:38,837
Bekah: Awesome. Thank you cuz
that sounds really awesome. And I

247
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:41,957
know that there's a lot of people
out there that are looking for

248
00:14:42,168 --> 00:14:45,288
different types of opportunities
and I think my first job

249
00:14:45,293 --> 00:14:48,707
experience, uh, full-time
position outside of college was

250
00:14:48,947 --> 00:14:52,873
at a nonprofit organization and I
really learned a lot. Through

251
00:14:52,873 --> 00:14:57,133
that experience and working on a
really small team of people, and

252
00:14:57,133 --> 00:15:01,033
I think it just provides like a
unique insight into the ways that

253
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:03,822
you can do things differently,
the communication, and it was

254
00:15:03,822 --> 00:15:07,163
nice to have that sense of
mission at the end of the day.

255
00:15:08,628 --> 00:15:12,378
Joe: Yeah. And one of the other
like biggest points of, you know,

256
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:15,888
especially like working on a
incredibly small team is you get

257
00:15:15,888 --> 00:15:19,457
exposed to a lot more. Whereas,
you know, if I went and I got a

258
00:15:19,457 --> 00:15:25,998
job, um, at some big megacorp. I
know that like my, the first six

259
00:15:25,998 --> 00:15:28,427
to eight months of my job would
be like, here, work on this

260
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:31,187
button, and that's all you're
ever going to do for the next six

261
00:15:31,187 --> 00:15:35,357
to eight months is this button.
Whereas, you know, I, I'm leading

262
00:15:35,357 --> 00:15:40,697
the rewrite of an entire site
right now and it's exciting and

263
00:15:40,697 --> 00:15:42,197
scary and exciting.

264
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:45,123
Bekah: Yeah, I like didn't know
somebody and that was their job.

265
00:15:45,123 --> 00:15:48,033
Like the first six months at a
big corp. It was just like

266
00:15:48,033 --> 00:15:49,293
dealing with three buttons.

267
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,370
Dan: I mean, buttons are
important. You know, you gotta

268
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:56,110
gotta make sure the buttons do
button things, I, I guess,

269
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:59,301
Bekah: Yes. If your buttons do
not do button things, then you're

270
00:15:59,301 --> 00:16:00,980
really in trouble. It's gonna be
bad.

271
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:01,660
Dan: Yeah. Yeah.

272
00:16:01,821 --> 00:16:03,951
Joe: make sure you get that exact
right shade of blue. You don't

273
00:16:03,951 --> 00:16:06,780
want it to be too blue, but you
want it to be blue enough.

274
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:09,480
Bekah: Mm-hmm. border radius,
it's gotta be perfect.

275
00:16:09,966 --> 00:16:10,265
Joe: Right.

276
00:16:11,342 --> 00:16:14,043
Bekah: Total aside for my
internal hackathon project, I was

277
00:16:14,043 --> 00:16:17,222
like all about the border radius.
I'm like, these border border

278
00:16:17,222 --> 00:16:20,972
radio is are Ray, what is the
plural of Radius?

279
00:16:21,337 --> 00:16:22,427
Dan: that was, that was it. Yeah.

280
00:16:22,863 --> 00:16:26,883
Bekah: Yeah. They didn't match
and I wasn't gonna let that go

281
00:16:27,263 --> 00:16:29,932
Joe: Line by line, every css.
Gotta make sure that they're

282
00:16:29,932 --> 00:16:30,802
pixel perfect.

283
00:16:31,148 --> 00:16:33,817
Bekah: I'm not, I'm not even good
at CSS. Like I think that's the

284
00:16:33,817 --> 00:16:37,837
funny part. Like I ended up
designing a lot of stuff and I'm

285
00:16:37,837 --> 00:16:40,748
really bad at design, so
apologies to anyone that saw my

286
00:16:40,748 --> 00:16:41,947
project. But we did win

287
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:45,607
Joe: Honestly, I think there's
probably only one person in on

288
00:16:45,613 --> 00:16:48,967
the on earth that's actually good
at css. Everyone else is just

289
00:16:48,972 --> 00:16:51,408
frustrated by it and just does it
cuz we have to.

290
00:16:52,447 --> 00:16:56,648
Bekah: We have what Dan, you've
been doing the CSS battles with

291
00:16:56,648 --> 00:17:02,107
Jörn who was on the podcast, um,
this season as well. What, what

292
00:17:02,107 --> 00:17:03,488
do you do in your CSS battles?

293
00:17:03,993 --> 00:17:08,583
Dan: those are fun. Yeah. So
it's, it's like CSS battle io or

294
00:17:08,587 --> 00:17:14,063
battles, I'm not sure. but the
the idea is, uh, you get like a

295
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:18,788
picture and then. A little iframe
and you have to basically add

296
00:17:19,057 --> 00:17:21,788
markup and CSS to make it look
like the picture, like exactly.

297
00:17:21,788 --> 00:17:24,758
You know, so if they overlap,
there's no difference. And then,

298
00:17:24,998 --> 00:17:28,117
um, you submit it and then like
it gives you a score based on,

299
00:17:28,988 --> 00:17:33,038
um, whether passed and then how
few characters you can use to get

300
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:36,637
it to do that. And as a, as a
group, we like kind of all just

301
00:17:36,637 --> 00:17:39,248
kind of hang out and do it
together, you know, sort of like

302
00:17:39,597 --> 00:17:41,647
somebody else will share. And
then like other people will

303
00:17:41,653 --> 00:17:46,553
either, Just like tag along or do
it on, you know, themselves on

304
00:17:46,553 --> 00:17:48,623
the side, you know, which is what
I usually do. I usually try to

305
00:17:48,623 --> 00:17:50,093
race everybody see what I can do,
but

306
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,853
Joe: are these like web layouts
that they're giving you or are

307
00:17:52,853 --> 00:17:54,053
they like, um, like

308
00:17:54,232 --> 00:17:56,873
Dan: Nope. They're like, they're
like designs. Yeah. They're like

309
00:17:56,873 --> 00:17:59,303
just little not web layouts at
all. Yeah.

310
00:17:59,873 --> 00:18:02,813
Joe: Okay. Cause yeah, cause I've
seen people who are like rec, you

311
00:18:02,813 --> 00:18:06,248
know, they're creating like these
incredible like, Graphic images

312
00:18:06,367 --> 00:18:08,107
using nothing but CSS

313
00:18:08,292 --> 00:18:08,782
Dan: Yeah.

314
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:10,657
Joe: and I, I wouldn't even know
where to begin.

315
00:18:11,212 --> 00:18:14,482
Dan: Yeah, I mean, like it's,
it's not like anywhere close to

316
00:18:14,482 --> 00:18:17,603
that, like, you know, that like
depth, you know what I mean? I

317
00:18:17,603 --> 00:18:19,583
mean, the ones we've done, and
we've only done a handful, but

318
00:18:20,093 --> 00:18:24,292
the one this time was just like
three little like semi-circles,

319
00:18:24,292 --> 00:18:27,893
you know, sort of. But one was
flipped and, you know, and so

320
00:18:27,893 --> 00:18:31,073
it's like a mix of trying to get
the design right and also trying

321
00:18:31,073 --> 00:18:34,012
to be efficient, you know? And I
don't know, we just usually start

322
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:35,962
by just like trying to get
something down and then see how

323
00:18:36,022 --> 00:18:39,563
everybody else did it. And then I
spent like two hours trying to

324
00:18:39,563 --> 00:18:44,393
get mine as small as possible.
Last week it was bad but also,

325
00:18:44,438 --> 00:18:47,093
Bekah: you update it after Jörn
made it?

326
00:18:47,542 --> 00:18:48,113
Dan: um,

327
00:18:48,337 --> 00:18:49,807
Bekah: It was like one fewer
character or something.

328
00:18:49,913 --> 00:18:54,256
Dan: I didn't, I didn't, yeah, I
didn't. It, uh, now that you

329
00:18:54,256 --> 00:18:54,556
reminded

330
00:18:54,691 --> 00:18:59,701
Bekah: Sorry. I'm sorry. It's fun
to, it's fun to watch everybody

331
00:18:59,701 --> 00:19:03,121
talking about it. I haven't
jumped into the challenge, but I

332
00:19:03,121 --> 00:19:03,931
don't know. It's

333
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:05,415
Dan: Yeah, it's fine.

334
00:19:05,431 --> 00:19:05,881
Bekah: like fun.

335
00:19:06,526 --> 00:19:08,625
Dan: Yeah, and we always like
have somebody just, you know,

336
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:10,665
somebody stream and everybody
kind of helps them, you know,

337
00:19:10,665 --> 00:19:13,875
kind of try out their approach
and there's always like a million

338
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:18,645
different ways to do it too. So,
um, that's part of the fun too,

339
00:19:18,645 --> 00:19:23,205
is seeing what everybody kind of
goes towards without like looking

340
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:26,056
at other people's, you know,
solutions first. So, I don't

341
00:19:26,056 --> 00:19:27,645
know. It is entertaining.

342
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:32,820
Bekah: So, um, kind of going
along with that, Joe, you talked

343
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:37,290
about enjoying the work that
you're doing, but you don't

344
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:43,395
really work with a team on. what
you're doing right now. Is that

345
00:19:43,395 --> 00:19:44,355
right? Or.

346
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:52,270
Joe: Yeah, well, sort of, yeah.
So I, um, I'm the only engineer

347
00:19:52,631 --> 00:19:56,740
actually on like the, on our
payroll, um, as a or an employee.

348
00:19:57,101 --> 00:20:03,540
Um, I work with. Two other
contractors. Um, and then it's

349
00:20:04,681 --> 00:20:09,391
interns and volunteers. So I've
only had one intern up until now,

350
00:20:09,395 --> 00:20:13,651
but I'm about to get like three
more, uh, next week, which is

351
00:20:13,651 --> 00:20:21,270
going to be fun and exciting. Um,
you know, so it's, it's, it, it's

352
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,340
been a bit of a change in
management style just because

353
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:27,346
like I'm used to. having a team
that is like there at a certain

354
00:20:27,346 --> 00:20:32,145
time, you know, but with this,
it's very, it's very async. So

355
00:20:32,536 --> 00:20:37,365
it's just a change of mindset of
like, you just need to take kind

356
00:20:37,365 --> 00:20:39,465
of like time outta the equation
really, and just be like, all

357
00:20:39,465 --> 00:20:43,036
right, is stuff kind of going at
the pace that it needs to be

358
00:20:43,036 --> 00:20:46,635
going? And, and so far we're,
we're good.

359
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:50,476
Bekah: Yeah. That's really great.
So it seems like you kind of get

360
00:20:50,476 --> 00:20:54,945
to be doing some mentorship with
your work, and I wonder, are

361
00:20:54,945 --> 00:20:59,355
there skills that you found in
hotel management that have helped

362
00:20:59,976 --> 00:21:03,076
transfer over to what you're
doing now or that you find to be

363
00:21:03,076 --> 00:21:05,746
useful that maybe other people
might not think of?

364
00:21:07,695 --> 00:21:12,675
Joe: I feel it. I mean, it's ma
mainly like the situation

365
00:21:12,675 --> 00:21:16,336
management was probably like my
biggest takeaway. Um, just

366
00:21:16,336 --> 00:21:22,036
because for like the longest part
of my time in hospitality, I was,

367
00:21:22,786 --> 00:21:25,996
I was managing more situations
than I was people. Like there,

368
00:21:25,996 --> 00:21:28,546
you know, there were some times
where I was managing people, um,

369
00:21:28,605 --> 00:21:33,316
you know, modest team sizes, but
a vast majority was like managing

370
00:21:33,316 --> 00:21:37,486
situations of like, okay, this is
cropped up. How do we fix.

371
00:21:38,296 --> 00:21:41,566
Because, you know, with hotels,
like you're dealing with the

372
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:47,115
craziest variable of them all,
and that's people Uh, so it's a,

373
00:21:47,121 --> 00:21:49,726
you know, so it's a lot of like,
on the fly problem solving. And I

374
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:52,816
think that kind of, that lends
itself into development because

375
00:21:53,086 --> 00:21:55,726
yeah, bugs crop up and, you know,
sometimes you gotta get real

376
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:56,026
creative.

377
00:21:58,961 --> 00:21:59,326
Bekah: Yeah.

378
00:22:00,096 --> 00:22:03,435
Joe: you know, other than that,
like with, you know, people

379
00:22:03,435 --> 00:22:08,175
management, I was also kind of
very lucky because with, um, the

380
00:22:08,175 --> 00:22:15,675
team that I did have, um, it was
a very diverse team. Um, mul, you

381
00:22:15,675 --> 00:22:18,976
know, everyone from different
cultures, you know, different

382
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:24,675
countries, different ages, um,
you know, but it was great cause

383
00:22:24,675 --> 00:22:27,875
we all just, we got along
together as like people, and

384
00:22:28,006 --> 00:22:31,486
that's, I think that's the
biggest asset to a team is like

385
00:22:31,486 --> 00:22:36,510
when you can all just get along,
you know? casually and, and you

386
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:39,211
know, with each other that just
kinda makes everything else fall

387
00:22:39,211 --> 00:22:45,270
into place. Um, yeah. Cause like,
I, I, my management style is

388
00:22:45,276 --> 00:22:48,540
like, I'm not very hard at
people. Like, I'm just, I just

389
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,971
treat people like people and I
think that's really all you can

390
00:22:50,971 --> 00:22:51,090
do.

391
00:22:53,296 --> 00:22:56,415
Bekah: Yeah, absolutely. And I'm
gonna back up in time a little

392
00:22:56,415 --> 00:23:02,026
bit because you went through 100
Devs bootcamp, and so for anybody

393
00:23:02,026 --> 00:23:05,026
that's not familiar with a
hundred devs, can you dive in a

394
00:23:05,026 --> 00:23:09,226
little bit more into how that's
run, what the community looks

395
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:11,685
like and what your experience was
with.

396
00:23:12,855 --> 00:23:17,385
Joe: Yeah, so, um, 100 devs. I,
I, so I went through the second

397
00:23:17,385 --> 00:23:21,826
cohort, uh, but it initially
started, uh, the first cohort

398
00:23:21,885 --> 00:23:30,060
was, I wanna say it was like
October-ish of 20. Uh, so there's

399
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:33,931
this guy named, uh, Leon Noel.
Um, he actually works for a

400
00:23:33,961 --> 00:23:38,851
nonprofit called Resilient
Coders. Uh, by day what Resilient

401
00:23:38,851 --> 00:23:44,760
Coders is, um, they're also kind
of like a, a bootcamp, uh, but

402
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,730
they work within certain, I think
they've got, I think they're in

403
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:52,020
like Boston, Philadelphia and
maybe somewhere else, but they

404
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:59,310
work in, um, trying to kind of
help people. like economically

405
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:02,520
disadvantaged backgrounds, um,
and just also bringing a lot more

406
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,851
diversity into the tech world. So
they work with a lot of, uh,

407
00:24:05,881 --> 00:24:07,891
people of color and stuff like
that. And, you know, just

408
00:24:07,891 --> 00:24:13,681
offering those resources. Um,
it's, I think they, it's like

409
00:24:13,681 --> 00:24:16,381
heavily, I don't know if it, if
it costs anything, uh, or if

410
00:24:16,381 --> 00:24:20,401
anything it's heavily subsidized.
Um, but they, they, it's more

411
00:24:20,401 --> 00:24:23,911
than just like a, here are the
buttons to press and here's how

412
00:24:23,911 --> 00:24:27,226
JavaScript works. It's all the
total package of. All right,

413
00:24:27,226 --> 00:24:30,695
here's how to code, but here's
how to interview. Here's how to

414
00:24:30,701 --> 00:24:34,455
network. Here's actually how to
get your foot in the door. So he

415
00:24:34,455 --> 00:24:39,016
took a lot of that and brought it
into 100 devs. So we just kind of

416
00:24:39,016 --> 00:24:44,776
brought it online, um, without
borders basically. And everything

417
00:24:44,836 --> 00:24:49,455
is a hundred percent free. If
anything, if you do 100 devs

418
00:24:49,726 --> 00:24:54,615
correctly, even before you get a
job, you're making. because one

419
00:24:54,615 --> 00:24:57,855
of the things that that happens
to that is, um, there's a, a

420
00:24:57,855 --> 00:25:02,175
whole section on freelancing. And
one of the assignments is you

421
00:25:02,181 --> 00:25:04,846
have to go out and you've gotta
get a, a freelance client. He's

422
00:25:04,851 --> 00:25:07,695
like, I want a signed contract
and it's gotta be worth at least

423
00:25:08,026 --> 00:25:14,476
x amount of dollars. Um, so, you
know, the, the great thing about

424
00:25:14,476 --> 00:25:17,596
that is, um, you start seeing in,
you know, inside the, the

425
00:25:17,596 --> 00:25:19,635
community, like everything is
kind of centered around the

426
00:25:19,641 --> 00:25:24,855
discord, um, which I think now is
up. Like 30 or 40,000 people,

427
00:25:24,855 --> 00:25:27,615
which is insane. Like, I don't
think anyone thought it was gonna

428
00:25:27,615 --> 00:25:30,766
get this big, but you kind of,
you start seeing people like

429
00:25:30,826 --> 00:25:36,586
celebrating like, Hey, like I got
$2,000 to do just this. And

430
00:25:36,675 --> 00:25:40,875
people are like, what can I
charge that? Yeah, of course you

431
00:25:40,875 --> 00:25:43,096
can. You know, if someone's
willing to pay it, you can charge

432
00:25:43,096 --> 00:25:48,105
it. So it, it's, it's also really
helped a lot of people kind of

433
00:25:49,066 --> 00:25:52,411
building confidence within
themselves. You know, cuz you,

434
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:54,901
especially if you're, if you
haven't really been in tech

435
00:25:54,901 --> 00:25:57,871
before you, you're like, I can't
ask someone to pay this much for

436
00:25:57,871 --> 00:26:02,101
that. And you realize, yeah, you
can, because they're not, you

437
00:26:02,101 --> 00:26:04,830
know, they're not paying you to
do like what might only be a few

438
00:26:04,836 --> 00:26:07,171
hours worth of work for you.
They're paying you just to get

439
00:26:07,171 --> 00:26:11,191
this done because they don't know
how to do it. They don't wanna

440
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:14,401
know how to do it. It's just,
that's not, that's not the best

441
00:26:14,401 --> 00:26:17,760
use of their time. You know, if
they're running the business,

442
00:26:18,121 --> 00:26:21,240
they need to be focused on
running the. and then you know,

443
00:26:22,111 --> 00:26:25,921
you're, cuz you're just really
providing a service to them and

444
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:28,820
you know they're willing to pay
for it.

445
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:32,911
Bekah: Yeah. Uh, it's really
great to see people coming

446
00:26:32,915 --> 00:26:36,540
together and doing that and
having that broken down in a way

447
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:42,270
that seems practical and usable
during the process. So do you

448
00:26:42,276 --> 00:26:46,171
work with teams or groups at any
point during the bootcamp?

449
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:52,965
Joe: so. because, yeah, so when,
when, when we first started,

450
00:26:53,326 --> 00:26:55,576
everyone was just kind of in
like, you know, like the, the

451
00:26:55,576 --> 00:26:59,296
discord was just one main channel
where everyone kind of

452
00:26:59,296 --> 00:27:03,195
congregated and it was kind of
overwhelming at first cuz there

453
00:27:03,195 --> 00:27:08,655
were, because again, like the
size ballooned. Um, but as we, as

454
00:27:08,655 --> 00:27:12,346
we went on, then they actually
started, um, breaking us off

455
00:27:12,346 --> 00:27:16,530
into, into other groups. So,
There was two different, uh,

456
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:19,590
categories that we were broken
off into. One of them was, um,

457
00:27:19,651 --> 00:27:23,131
like regional. So you would, you
know, you could pair up with

458
00:27:23,131 --> 00:27:27,151
people who were kind of within
either the same city or the same

459
00:27:27,151 --> 00:27:30,090
time zone, at least as you. And
then another one was just kind of

460
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:35,971
like, um, like identity and
affinity based. So, um, like

461
00:27:35,971 --> 00:27:44,521
there was groups for like over
40, over 30, um, adhd. There was,

462
00:27:44,551 --> 00:27:47,281
there was a bunch of other ones,
but yeah, so you could, um, so

463
00:27:47,281 --> 00:27:50,281
you could also be kind of broken
up into that. And that's

464
00:27:50,551 --> 00:27:53,192
generally where our, our groups
could kind of form because

465
00:27:53,192 --> 00:27:56,642
you're, you're getting into, uh,
conversation with a smaller group

466
00:27:56,646 --> 00:28:01,082
of people. But we would also
have, um, like project nights

467
00:28:01,082 --> 00:28:05,311
where we would go on this one
platform called Remo, which, um,

468
00:28:05,432 --> 00:28:09,031
the first time we did it, we, we
broke it because there was so

469
00:28:09,031 --> 00:28:13,652
many of us on it. Uh, but Remos
kind of like, um, it's almost

470
00:28:13,652 --> 00:28:17,311
like a virtual conference in a
way that like there's, you know,

471
00:28:17,311 --> 00:28:20,551
it has like a little floor plan
layout that has like a bunch of

472
00:28:20,557 --> 00:28:23,102
little tables, but each table is
like a, like a little zoom

473
00:28:23,471 --> 00:28:26,701
breakout room with a maximum of
like six people. So we would just

474
00:28:26,701 --> 00:28:29,372
all get shuffled into these kind
of like, random tables. So we

475
00:28:29,372 --> 00:28:32,342
would just meet these people for
the first time and go, all right,

476
00:28:32,372 --> 00:28:33,571
let's build something together.

477
00:28:34,505 --> 00:28:37,085
Bekah: and. Seems like a really
interesting approach, right? If

478
00:28:37,085 --> 00:28:40,234
you throw a bunch of people into
a room and try and figure it out.

479
00:28:40,234 --> 00:28:43,265
So how did you kind of work with
the other people to figure out

480
00:28:43,269 --> 00:28:45,815
what your roles would be and how
your project would develop?

481
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:49,211
Joe: Um, I, I often kind of found
myself taking the lead a little

482
00:28:49,211 --> 00:28:52,632
bit just because everyone was
kind of sitting back and like

483
00:28:52,636 --> 00:28:55,721
looking around. So I was like,
all right, I guess I'll. I'll

484
00:28:55,721 --> 00:29:02,412
gets kicked off. Um, I, I would
just, I would kind of just at

485
00:29:02,412 --> 00:29:04,241
least break down of like, all
right, this is what needs to be

486
00:29:04,241 --> 00:29:09,162
done. Who wants to work on this?
So I, I don't really like to kind

487
00:29:09,162 --> 00:29:12,041
of assign things. I, I want
people to like volunteer for it

488
00:29:12,047 --> 00:29:15,011
first. Cuz if you, you know,
you're gonna volunteer for it,

489
00:29:15,011 --> 00:29:20,412
you're gonna be more motivated to
actually do that. Um, but I think

490
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:26,336
some people will just look. as a
whole and they just don't know

491
00:29:26,336 --> 00:29:28,916
where to start. So, you know, you
need to kind of just break it

492
00:29:28,916 --> 00:29:31,916
down to those smaller pieces and
then it's easier for them to, to

493
00:29:31,922 --> 00:29:36,297
digest and, you know, and kind of
wrap your head around cuz it's

494
00:29:36,297 --> 00:29:39,596
not just like, oh, all of this.
No, just work on this little part

495
00:29:39,596 --> 00:29:41,846
right over here. Um,

496
00:29:41,856 --> 00:29:44,096
Bekah: I think that's great. It
seems like it, that matches up

497
00:29:44,096 --> 00:29:47,037
with your previous career skills
too.

498
00:29:48,057 --> 00:29:50,666
Joe: Yeah. And it, I mean, it is
even, you know, it's carried

499
00:29:50,672 --> 00:29:55,106
forward. Even the way that I'm
working today, cuz you know,

500
00:29:55,106 --> 00:29:59,277
right now we are working on a
complete and total ground up

501
00:29:59,277 --> 00:30:06,477
rewrite of, of our web app. Um,
so I, I just go into, to Jira,

502
00:30:06,686 --> 00:30:09,326
break everything down into small
tickets and just kind of leave

503
00:30:09,326 --> 00:30:13,106
everything new column. I'm like,
all right, have at it, you know,

504
00:30:13,106 --> 00:30:15,896
and it, and if it gets to the
point where some things are

505
00:30:15,896 --> 00:30:18,987
starting to get stale, then
that's where yeah, I'm either

506
00:30:18,987 --> 00:30:23,207
going to assign it. Maybe just
take it on myself.

507
00:30:23,928 --> 00:30:25,847
Dan: Yeah. That's cool. It's cool
to hear. And that's, that's,

508
00:30:25,847 --> 00:30:28,907
that's, that's a hard skill to,
to learn. Uh, you know,

509
00:30:29,538 --> 00:30:32,178
especially the fact that you just
kind of came into it while you

510
00:30:32,178 --> 00:30:35,238
were learning this stuff, already
having that ability is, um,

511
00:30:36,258 --> 00:30:36,948
That's very cool. Very.

512
00:30:38,012 --> 00:30:40,593
Joe: Yeah. Which, and it's a,
it's a bit of a departure from

513
00:30:40,593 --> 00:30:44,682
like my normal life cuz generally
I am not organized in my personal

514
00:30:44,688 --> 00:30:49,413
life. Like if we go downstairs
and look at my dining room table,

515
00:30:49,413 --> 00:30:51,873
it's not a dining room table.
It's just like a we'll put stuff

516
00:30:51,873 --> 00:30:53,883
here for right now and we'll deal
with it later.

517
00:30:55,413 --> 00:30:58,472
Bekah: I had a boss once who told
me I was the most organized

518
00:30:58,472 --> 00:31:02,222
person she had ever met, and I'm
like, I have a tendency to be

519
00:31:02,222 --> 00:31:06,123
organized with work things, but
when it comes to home things, I

520
00:31:06,123 --> 00:31:11,282
don't know. It's I, I have my, my
piles, you know.

521
00:31:11,863 --> 00:31:14,913
Joe: Yeah. Cause even like when,
um, you know, when I worked in an

522
00:31:14,913 --> 00:31:19,083
office, uh, like. I had piles on
my desks, but I knew where stuff

523
00:31:19,083 --> 00:31:21,512
was because those piles were
chronological. So I could be

524
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:24,423
like, oh, well this happened
around this time, so we're about

525
00:31:24,573 --> 00:31:28,952
here But sometimes those piles
just ended up being like a, oh,

526
00:31:28,952 --> 00:31:31,472
I'll just throw this out in two
weeks instead of like throwing it

527
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:32,163
out right now.

528
00:31:33,557 --> 00:31:37,758
Bekah: Yeah, I feel that. I feel
that too. I recently was looking

529
00:31:37,758 --> 00:31:43,698
for something that I worked on
this summer. and I thought maybe

530
00:31:43,698 --> 00:31:46,877
I drafted it online. And so I
looked through like all of my

531
00:31:46,877 --> 00:31:49,998
regular places. I looked in docs,
I looked in Confluence, I looked

532
00:31:49,998 --> 00:31:53,417
in Google, keep, like, looked
through my email, not there, and

533
00:31:53,417 --> 00:31:57,048
I'm like, oh crap, it's gotta be
in a notebook, but, but the

534
00:31:57,048 --> 00:32:02,327
problem is I have like 20
notebooks or something. And so

535
00:32:02,327 --> 00:32:04,307
then I was looking through all
those notebooks until I finally

536
00:32:04,307 --> 00:32:08,178
was like, you know what, I can
just redo this entire thing and

537
00:32:08,178 --> 00:32:09,938
it will be fine. Like,

538
00:32:11,472 --> 00:32:16,653
Joe: Hey, cause. because even,
um, you know, cuz working in

539
00:32:16,653 --> 00:32:20,522
hotels, like you get a lot of
emails cuz you're just on like 50

540
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:22,952
different email lists and you
probably only care about two of

541
00:32:22,952 --> 00:32:26,103
them, but you still have to be on
on the other ones. And I had some

542
00:32:26,103 --> 00:32:28,593
coworkers who would like
meticulously have like the very

543
00:32:28,623 --> 00:32:32,012
large nested folder structure and
like, oh, this goes here, this

544
00:32:32,012 --> 00:32:35,073
goes here, this goes here. Mine
was like, everything goes into

545
00:32:35,073 --> 00:32:37,413
archive. And people were like,
well, how do you find anything?

546
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:39,482
I'm like, Hey, do you notice this
thing up here? It's called a

547
00:32:39,482 --> 00:32:42,887
search bar. Type in three words.
You get it

548
00:32:45,593 --> 00:32:51,423
Dan: Yeah, that, that one, uh,
you know, Gmail came. because it

549
00:32:51,423 --> 00:32:53,343
wasn't really an option before
that. You had to like, you know,

550
00:32:53,343 --> 00:32:55,472
you only had certain amount of
space that you could have on your

551
00:32:55,472 --> 00:32:57,573
email, you know, whatever. And so
you had to make all those

552
00:32:57,573 --> 00:33:00,573
decisions. Yeah. And then Gmail
came out and was like, here's a

553
00:33:00,577 --> 00:33:03,423
gigabyte of storage, which
doesn't sound like much now, but

554
00:33:03,452 --> 00:33:04,712
you know, then it

555
00:33:04,748 --> 00:33:05,807
Joe: but back then, yeah.

556
00:33:05,972 --> 00:33:09,962
Dan: big deal. And yeah, I did
the same thing. I and Emily is

557
00:33:09,962 --> 00:33:12,962
the same way. Yeah. My wife has,
you know, nested folders and

558
00:33:12,962 --> 00:33:17,403
labels and all these automations
and stuff, and I'm just like, I'm

559
00:33:17,403 --> 00:33:22,502
lucky if I even archive it. you
know? Uh, but the search is, you

560
00:33:22,502 --> 00:33:24,663
know, the search is like the key
for that. Obviously being able

561
00:33:24,663 --> 00:33:24,932
to,

562
00:33:25,968 --> 00:33:27,377
Joe: Yeah, well, sometimes you
get to the point where you're

563
00:33:27,377 --> 00:33:29,357
just like, all right, I'm just
gonna select everything from here

564
00:33:29,357 --> 00:33:34,323
down and just put it to the
archive. Cuz if I haven't. For it

565
00:33:34,323 --> 00:33:36,343
or add it yet. I'm probably not
going to

566
00:33:36,633 --> 00:33:41,133
Dan: yeah, no, that's, um, this
sort of thing is I think, uh,

567
00:33:41,163 --> 00:33:48,887
pretty common. I don't know. I, I
have ADHD and and, and, uh, I

568
00:33:48,887 --> 00:33:51,528
know Bekah does too. We've talked
about it a bunch on the podcast,

569
00:33:51,798 --> 00:33:56,178
but I think it's pretty common to
me. Okay. I was, I knew you did,

570
00:33:56,178 --> 00:34:00,948
but I didn't wanna like really,
you know, uh, um, diagnose you on

571
00:34:00,952 --> 00:34:04,847
the podcast. But, uh, it's a very
common thing I think with, um,

572
00:34:05,928 --> 00:34:08,748
people with ADHD is like, we
learn these coping mechanisms,

573
00:34:08,748 --> 00:34:12,438
all, all these different things,
ways to be successful at what we.

574
00:34:13,762 --> 00:34:16,637
but like our brains aren't still
like, set up like that. And so

575
00:34:16,697 --> 00:34:18,978
lots of times there's, we all
have these areas at home or, or

576
00:34:18,978 --> 00:34:22,878
wherever, you know, where it's
not as vital to be on top of

577
00:34:22,878 --> 00:34:26,777
everything, right? Nobody is
going to be, uh, I don't know,

578
00:34:26,807 --> 00:34:30,228
losing money or something if my
clothes aren't picked up, you

579
00:34:30,228 --> 00:34:32,748
know what I mean? Like right away
or whatever, you know? And so,

580
00:34:32,748 --> 00:34:35,628
um, I, I, I, uh, I've been
learning about these coping

581
00:34:35,628 --> 00:34:38,688
mechanisms, um, and things like
that and, and like even

582
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:43,623
identifying things as coping
mechanisms. Um, Since my, when

583
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:46,833
you diagnosed my, my son got
diagnosed, uh, recently with ADHD

584
00:34:46,833 --> 00:34:50,643
as well, and so like, I'm not now
like relearning about all, all a

585
00:34:50,648 --> 00:34:52,532
lot of this stuff, you know, from
kind of a different perspective.

586
00:34:52,532 --> 00:34:53,563
It's, it's really interesting.

587
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:58,112
Joe: Yeah, and cuz like, I'm, I'm
actually, you know, I'm one of

588
00:34:58,112 --> 00:35:02,898
the like late in life diagnoses.
Um, like I only got. The formal

589
00:35:02,898 --> 00:35:10,097
diagnosis, um, back in like April
of, of 2022. Um, and I think

590
00:35:10,103 --> 00:35:15,737
it's, you know, cause it's before
really before the pandemic, I

591
00:35:15,737 --> 00:35:19,068
just felt like everything was
just so busy and chaotic and that

592
00:35:19,068 --> 00:35:22,518
was just the way that it was. And
then when, you know, like the

593
00:35:22,518 --> 00:35:24,708
pandemic happened and like
everything just kind of shut down

594
00:35:24,708 --> 00:35:29,373
and you're just kind of like, you
know, the entire existence was

595
00:35:29,373 --> 00:35:31,952
like disrupted. And you're just
kind of sitting around watching

596
00:35:31,952 --> 00:35:36,242
Netflix and thinking way too
much. And then, you know, a lot

597
00:35:36,242 --> 00:35:39,543
of like self-reflection. You're
like, maybe things don't always

598
00:35:39,543 --> 00:35:44,253
have to be this difficult, you
know? Cause I, I know that

599
00:35:44,253 --> 00:35:49,353
there's been a big spike in
diagnosis since the pandemic and

600
00:35:49,353 --> 00:35:53,793
I think that's just been a, a big
pattern of like, you know, people

601
00:35:53,793 --> 00:35:58,217
just had a lot of time to. Sit
back and just kind of reevaluate

602
00:35:58,217 --> 00:36:03,228
things and going, this isn't as
hard as it is for me, as it is

603
00:36:03,228 --> 00:36:04,498
for everyone else, you know?

604
00:36:06,523 --> 00:36:08,043
Dan: Yeah, yeah, yeah. For.

605
00:36:09,572 --> 00:36:11,672
Bekah: So I probably mentioned
this on the podcast before, but

606
00:36:12,152 --> 00:36:16,532
uh, Dan ha was telling me about
his ADHD experience when I was

607
00:36:16,532 --> 00:36:19,233
working for him, and he was
saying things and I was like, oh,

608
00:36:19,237 --> 00:36:22,713
that's not how everybody does it.
Like in, in my mind, I had like

609
00:36:22,713 --> 00:36:26,012
no idea. It was totally off my
radar. And I remember telling my

610
00:36:26,012 --> 00:36:28,262
sister-in-law when I got
diagnosed, I was like, yeah, I

611
00:36:28,262 --> 00:36:31,472
got diagnosed with AD or no. I
said, I think I might have adhd.

612
00:36:31,472 --> 00:36:35,733
And she was like, oh, you didn't
know. And I was like, oh, no.

613
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:39,393
Dan: Nope. I, yeah, I, I was
diagnosed, yeah, in like 2019,

614
00:36:39,393 --> 00:36:42,333
but I exact same thing, except
with, with Emily with my wifi. I

615
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:45,452
was, was like, kind think I have
80. She's just like, oh, I just

616
00:36:45,452 --> 00:36:48,543
thought you knew no, I didn't
know.

617
00:36:49,592 --> 00:36:50,672
Joe: I don't wanna bring anything
up.

618
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:55,322
Dan: She's just like, yeah, I
know. I just, uh, yeah. You know,

619
00:36:55,322 --> 00:36:58,833
it's, I don't know. It is a very,
uh, interesting experience and

620
00:36:58,833 --> 00:37:01,682
so, yeah. So when the pandemic
hit, I was, that was when I was.

621
00:37:02,373 --> 00:37:05,072
I'm really learning about it, uh,
for the first time, you know,

622
00:37:05,132 --> 00:37:09,452
and, and kind of finding other
people to talk to about it and

623
00:37:09,483 --> 00:37:10,143
all of that stuff.

624
00:37:10,682 --> 00:37:13,353
Joe: well it, I mean also, you
know, cause we're all, you know,

625
00:37:13,532 --> 00:37:18,047
around like the same age, so
when. you know, we were younger

626
00:37:18,047 --> 00:37:22,007
and in school it, like, ADHD
really wasn't thought about

627
00:37:22,007 --> 00:37:24,197
unless you were like that kid
that was just bouncing off the

628
00:37:24,197 --> 00:37:29,057
walls. But, you know, like, cuz
one of the, you know, the, the

629
00:37:29,387 --> 00:37:32,117
things that was like, oh, well
you're, you're doing well in

630
00:37:32,123 --> 00:37:35,867
school, you can't have it. Or
like, you know, it was also very

631
00:37:35,867 --> 00:37:39,498
generative, like, oh, girls don't
have that. That's only a boy.

632
00:37:41,237 --> 00:37:43,728
Dan: Yeah. And yeah, and a lot of
that is because that bouncing off

633
00:37:43,733 --> 00:37:48,467
the walls thing was the only,
like, it was being disruptive in,

634
00:37:48,467 --> 00:37:50,987
in different environments was
like the only basis for diagnosis

635
00:37:50,992 --> 00:37:54,557
before. Yeah. And, uh, it's
gendered because of that, because

636
00:37:54,768 --> 00:37:58,427
women are taught not to do that
much more than boys are, you

637
00:37:58,427 --> 00:38:01,818
know, um, the girls and boys I
guess when they're, when they're

638
00:38:01,818 --> 00:38:05,418
kids, uh, in America,
unfortunately, you know, and so,

639
00:38:05,748 --> 00:38:07,697
yeah, it, it's, it's a weird
thing, but I'm, I'm, it seems

640
00:38:07,697 --> 00:38:10,878
like it's been changing a lot
more recently, and I hope it

641
00:38:10,907 --> 00:38:13,007
continues to improve because I
think, you know, I mean, I've

642
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:16,657
found, I've personally found
being diagnosed very valuable.

643
00:38:16,663 --> 00:38:21,213
It's, it's been like a
interesting. Not always easy

644
00:38:21,213 --> 00:38:24,932
journey you know, but, um, but
yeah, it's, I don't know,

645
00:38:25,487 --> 00:38:28,288
Joe: Yeah. I think the biggest
thing is it helps you at least

646
00:38:29,268 --> 00:38:34,398
kind of rationalize what's
happening inside, you know, and.

647
00:38:35,327 --> 00:38:37,938
I think also, you know, like, and
the fact that you were, you know,

648
00:38:37,938 --> 00:38:42,737
you were able, that your son was
diagnosed, you actually have the

649
00:38:42,742 --> 00:38:47,297
ability to make sure that his
life is not going to be as

650
00:38:47,302 --> 00:38:50,418
difficult as yours was going
through. Like, you know, like

651
00:38:50,418 --> 00:38:54,737
that, that period of school, uh,
you know, cuz like, I, I just

652
00:38:54,737 --> 00:38:58,577
remember of like always getting
like harp on and be like, why are

653
00:38:58,577 --> 00:39:01,518
you waiting till the absolute
last. You know, you've had a

654
00:39:01,523 --> 00:39:03,527
month to do this. Why are we
doing this night before? I'm

655
00:39:03,527 --> 00:39:06,797
like, because this is how it gets
done, and I'd always get it done.

656
00:39:07,038 --> 00:39:09,498
It was painful while I was doing
it, but it always got done.

657
00:39:10,632 --> 00:39:14,713
Dan: Yeah. I can't always say
that it the same my personal

658
00:39:14,713 --> 00:39:16,873
experience of actually ever
getting things done, but you

659
00:39:16,873 --> 00:39:19,503
know. but for sure
procrastinating. Yeah. And like,

660
00:39:19,532 --> 00:39:22,023
and, and back to what you said
about like trying to provide

661
00:39:22,023 --> 00:39:26,193
stuff for, for my son, for
Bennett, it's like the, yeah. I

662
00:39:26,193 --> 00:39:27,543
don't want him to have that
experience, you know? And I

663
00:39:27,543 --> 00:39:31,023
didn't know why, like, I couldn't
do homework and my, my parents

664
00:39:31,023 --> 00:39:34,202
were, you know, I mean like good
supportive parents, uh, like kind

665
00:39:34,202 --> 00:39:37,112
of disappointed. My grades were
awful. my test scores were really

666
00:39:37,112 --> 00:39:41,012
high and my grades were bad. And
I, it's like now a pretty, like,

667
00:39:41,322 --> 00:39:46,233
typical, I think a, a very common
anyway. you know, sign or

668
00:39:46,233 --> 00:39:51,302
whatever, un undiagnosed, uh,
adhd. But it's just like it. I

669
00:39:51,302 --> 00:39:53,913
still don't know how to do
homework. I don't know how to get

670
00:39:53,913 --> 00:39:56,373
people to do homework. You know,
like, so part of this was like

671
00:39:56,523 --> 00:39:59,552
getting some tools for me to
like, help, help him, you know,

672
00:39:59,793 --> 00:40:03,152
cuz I, like, I don't know what
the right solution is. He has

673
00:40:03,722 --> 00:40:06,842
also, he's in first grade and has
homework, which is just like

674
00:40:06,842 --> 00:40:09,992
killing me. Like, I, I, my first
instinct was like, no, we're not

675
00:40:09,992 --> 00:40:12,003
doing this at all. We're, we're
just not doing that. But I feel

676
00:40:12,003 --> 00:40:16,068
like that's probably not. The
whole school career thing, so,

677
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:17,307
Joe: Right. You're like,

678
00:40:17,327 --> 00:40:17,677
Dan: uh,

679
00:40:17,967 --> 00:40:20,217
Joe: these things off on 'em. I'm
like, oh, we can wait till later

680
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:20,887
to do that.

681
00:40:21,628 --> 00:40:22,757
Dan: yeah, but

682
00:40:22,972 --> 00:40:26,012
Bekah: the very light, least you
can communicate on his behalf to

683
00:40:26,012 --> 00:40:29,163
people, because especially with
like kids, they don't, they don't

684
00:40:29,163 --> 00:40:31,833
know what's going on or what's
happening or why it's happening

685
00:40:31,833 --> 00:40:34,487
or. You know, in the case of one
of my kids, they don't really

686
00:40:34,487 --> 00:40:37,157
care why it's happening. They're
just having a good time, you

687
00:40:37,487 --> 00:40:41,117
know, So like trying to break
that down and communicate with

688
00:40:41,117 --> 00:40:44,927
them and communicate with
teachers as needed, I think goes

689
00:40:44,932 --> 00:40:48,617
a long way to help everybody be
on the same page and your kids

690
00:40:48,617 --> 00:40:49,427
feel supported.

691
00:40:50,333 --> 00:40:53,378
Joe: Yeah. And I mean, uh,
probably the, the other biggest,

692
00:40:53,887 --> 00:40:57,487
you know, valuable thing is just
the fact that like, you can help

693
00:40:57,492 --> 00:41:03,217
him understand like what's going
on in his mind, because I don't

694
00:41:03,217 --> 00:41:05,978
know about, you know, for you
guys, but like, you know, back

695
00:41:05,978 --> 00:41:08,978
then it was like, if you're
procrastinating, that's because

696
00:41:08,978 --> 00:41:11,552
you've chosen to procrastinate.
That's the way it was drilled

697
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:14,402
into you. Like, why are you
choosing to make things harder

698
00:41:14,402 --> 00:41:16,742
for yourself? And you're like,
I'm not, like, I literally, it

699
00:41:16,742 --> 00:41:20,103
doesn't exist in my mind until
like now tomorrow,

700
00:41:22,262 --> 00:41:25,322
Bekah: I think I, my reaction has
always been opposite, so I've

701
00:41:25,327 --> 00:41:28,652
never really procrastinated. That
gives me a lot of anxiety, but

702
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:31,172
it's in the other extreme, like
it's gonna be done a week

703
00:41:31,172 --> 00:41:35,463
beforehand, so I know that it's
done and that I, and if something

704
00:41:35,463 --> 00:41:39,572
happens, like I still have more
time to do it, but. And I think

705
00:41:39,793 --> 00:41:42,422
I, I have been speaking to more
and more adult women who have

706
00:41:42,422 --> 00:41:46,112
ADHD. They all got good grades in
high school. They weren't

707
00:41:46,112 --> 00:41:49,322
disruptive. So, you know, a lot
of, like the common markers are,

708
00:41:49,503 --> 00:41:53,583
are not the issues. And a lot of
it comes down to interpersonal

709
00:41:53,583 --> 00:41:56,643
communication, relationships with
other people, and like

710
00:41:56,882 --> 00:42:00,722
recognizing that for me, made a
huge difference in how I

711
00:42:00,728 --> 00:42:04,347
communicate with other people,
how I understand myself. How I

712
00:42:04,353 --> 00:42:07,588
understand social situations,
because I always used to say I

713
00:42:07,588 --> 00:42:11,668
was a shy introvert, and I'm not
really sure. I, I think I'm just,

714
00:42:11,697 --> 00:42:15,898
um, just a shy, ADHD person like
introvert and extrovert don't

715
00:42:15,898 --> 00:42:20,518
really serve me anymore because I
think that there are times where

716
00:42:20,728 --> 00:42:26,608
the ADHD energy comes out when
I'm in social situations and that

717
00:42:26,757 --> 00:42:30,657
feels very extrovert. But there
are other times where I think

718
00:42:30,688 --> 00:42:36,858
having to, um, Like behave in
ways that are socially acceptable

719
00:42:36,858 --> 00:42:41,297
and not ADHD behaviors becomes
really exhausting, which would

720
00:42:41,297 --> 00:42:44,688
be, uh, something that somebody
might classify as being an

721
00:42:44,688 --> 00:42:47,688
introvert. So I'm not really sure
where I stand on that, but I

722
00:42:47,688 --> 00:42:50,717
think what's been helpful to me,
at least right now, is

723
00:42:50,722 --> 00:42:54,378
recognizing like, all right, you
know, if I have to be in a crowd

724
00:42:54,378 --> 00:42:59,268
of people where I have to behave
in these, uh, these ways, I'm

725
00:42:59,358 --> 00:43:03,288
going to be really tired after
that. You know, if I'm gonna be

726
00:43:03,288 --> 00:43:06,887
giving, I am always exhausted
after giving a talk, and I think

727
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:11,867
it's because I have to stay
focused for that amount of time,

728
00:43:11,958 --> 00:43:14,927
you know? And after that I'm
like, all right, I just need to

729
00:43:14,927 --> 00:43:18,947
go, like, sit in a chair
somewhere and be by myself for a

730
00:43:18,947 --> 00:43:22,608
little bit, regain that energy
before I can come back out. But I

731
00:43:22,608 --> 00:43:27,527
think that that's really driven
by that the, the ADHD part of my

732
00:43:27,527 --> 00:43:27,768
brain.

733
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:30,978
Joe: Yeah, like, I think like
with, with like public speaking,

734
00:43:30,978 --> 00:43:33,588
not only do you have to like stay
focused, but like the fact that

735
00:43:33,588 --> 00:43:37,518
you have like everyone looking at
you, it's hard not to like, you

736
00:43:37,523 --> 00:43:40,757
know, like let your mind break
away going, well, what is that

737
00:43:40,757 --> 00:43:42,978
person thinking about me? What is
that person think about me? They

738
00:43:42,978 --> 00:43:44,568
hate this, but they love it.

739
00:43:45,827 --> 00:43:47,898
Bekah: Yeah, this was the whole
thing last year. Dan came to my

740
00:43:47,898 --> 00:43:52,518
talk at KCDC on, uh, TensorFlow
Js. And I, really struggled.

741
00:43:52,668 --> 00:43:55,398
There were people that got up and
walked out, which is like normal,

742
00:43:55,402 --> 00:43:59,838
like people do that, you know,
but I just could not recover from

743
00:43:59,842 --> 00:44:03,378
those moments where, and I just
like felt terrible out about the

744
00:44:03,378 --> 00:44:06,527
talk for the rest of the day.
Didn't matter what anybody else

745
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:07,157
said to me.

746
00:44:07,413 --> 00:44:09,873
Joe: Yeah. Because in your mind
it's not like, oh, they need to

747
00:44:09,873 --> 00:44:11,672
go to the bathroom. You're like,
they hate me.

748
00:44:14,327 --> 00:44:16,757
Dan: And the whole rest of the
room stayed and, and enjoyed the

749
00:44:16,757 --> 00:44:17,467
talk too.

750
00:44:18,018 --> 00:44:19,277
Bekah: Doesn't matter. Those
people don't matter.

751
00:44:19,748 --> 00:44:20,307
Dan: right?

752
00:44:20,552 --> 00:44:20,972
Joe: one who broke it.

753
00:44:23,358 --> 00:44:25,967
Bekah: Yeah. I'm glad that we're
talking about this like less than

754
00:44:25,967 --> 00:44:30,827
a week before. I'm going to give
a talk. Super anxious about it.

755
00:44:30,827 --> 00:44:31,248
Until then,

756
00:44:33,213 --> 00:44:38,072
Joe: Yeah. But I, I think, you
know, at least kind of knowing

757
00:44:38,072 --> 00:44:44,282
it, you, you know, you can kind
of. Model, you know, like design

758
00:44:44,282 --> 00:44:45,782
your behavior around it. Like,
you know, like you're saying

759
00:44:45,782 --> 00:44:49,652
about being in, you know, in
large crowds, you know, you know,

760
00:44:49,652 --> 00:44:52,983
like, alright, I'm, I'm not gonna
do well with this. So you can at

761
00:44:52,987 --> 00:44:56,373
least plan like all I'm just
going to go, you know, take a

762
00:44:56,373 --> 00:44:58,112
walk off somewhere else, you
know, somewhere else and just

763
00:44:58,112 --> 00:45:00,302
take some deep breaths and just
kinda center myself and then I

764
00:45:00,302 --> 00:45:03,063
can go back in there refreshed
instead of just trying to like

765
00:45:03,302 --> 00:45:04,682
hammer through it all in one go.

766
00:45:05,807 --> 00:45:08,987
Bekah: Yeah. Yeah. And I do find
that one of the things that helps

767
00:45:08,987 --> 00:45:13,788
me is knowing somebody there, uh,
particularly someone that I've

768
00:45:13,788 --> 00:45:17,597
met before, because I know, like,
is this a person that is not

769
00:45:17,597 --> 00:45:21,648
gonna judge my behavior in this
moment? If I'm too loud, if I'm

770
00:45:21,648 --> 00:45:26,538
talking too fast, if I go off
topic in on 27 tangents in a

771
00:45:26,538 --> 00:45:31,788
conversation, because then that,
that just is. One of those spaces

772
00:45:31,788 --> 00:45:35,538
where I don't feel like I need to
be editing myself before I speak.

773
00:45:35,702 --> 00:45:41,282
Joe: Mm-hmm. Yeah. Cause like, I,
I went to, um, this AWS event,

774
00:45:41,342 --> 00:45:46,623
um, in DC you know, a few months
ago, and, I was hoping that I was

775
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:49,112
gonna at least, you know, like,
you know, know some other people

776
00:45:49,112 --> 00:45:51,273
there, you know, meet up with
some other people, but that

777
00:45:51,273 --> 00:45:55,293
didn't end up happening. So at
like, some of like the end of the

778
00:45:55,293 --> 00:45:59,163
night, like networking things,
like one of them I managed to

779
00:45:59,163 --> 00:46:02,432
actually strike up, uh,
conversations with, um, a couple

780
00:46:02,432 --> 00:46:05,313
of these girls and we just kinda
hung out the entire time. That

781
00:46:05,313 --> 00:46:08,358
was really. the next night, which
was like the final one where it

782
00:46:08,358 --> 00:46:11,148
was like everything was like, you
know, big, crazy loud, and like

783
00:46:11,148 --> 00:46:13,818
they've got people jumping on
trampolines and doing flips and

784
00:46:13,818 --> 00:46:17,807
stuff like that on stage. I tried
to kind of like insert myself

785
00:46:17,807 --> 00:46:20,327
into this one table, and then it
was just kind of like, oh, hi,

786
00:46:20,327 --> 00:46:22,427
you know, mind if I da, da da.
And then everything's kind of

787
00:46:22,427 --> 00:46:26,958
fell silent and I was like, oh,
okay. Now this is awkward looking

788
00:46:26,958 --> 00:46:31,322
around for an escape. And the
other thing too is like, I. I,

789
00:46:31,532 --> 00:46:35,222
you know, also stopped drinking.
So I was like, oh no, I don't

790
00:46:35,222 --> 00:46:38,702
even have like that social
lubricant anymore. And just

791
00:46:38,702 --> 00:46:41,163
between like all that and like
everything that's happening, I

792
00:46:41,168 --> 00:46:43,893
was like, you know what? Let's
just call this tonight. Let's

793
00:46:43,893 --> 00:46:48,782
just go home. let's go home. Pet
the dog. Watch some tv, eat some

794
00:46:48,782 --> 00:46:48,963
dinner.

795
00:46:50,672 --> 00:46:54,182
Bekah: Yeah. Well, I think that's
really being able to think

796
00:46:54,182 --> 00:46:58,112
through that and understand,
okay, it's not, it's not worth it

797
00:46:58,112 --> 00:47:02,853
to continue to push this, like,
this isn't doing me any good, and

798
00:47:02,853 --> 00:47:07,713
so it's better for me to preserve
myself, my energy and to, you

799
00:47:07,713 --> 00:47:12,693
know, do do something that is
better for my mental health or

800
00:47:13,083 --> 00:47:17,072
physical health or whatever. Uh,
it, that self-awareness I think

801
00:47:17,072 --> 00:47:20,373
is really key to anything you do
really.

802
00:47:20,748 --> 00:47:21,047
Joe: Yeah,

803
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:24,831
Bekah: We've made this the ADHD
episode officially,

804
00:47:25,356 --> 00:47:29,826
Joe: right. Yeah. How surprising.
We planned one topic and we ended

805
00:47:29,826 --> 00:47:31,706
up with a completely different
one. Who would've thought.

806
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:35,510
Bekah: which I'm totally fine
with. I think that this is a

807
00:47:35,516 --> 00:47:43,590
really good conversation to have,
right? It the I get. Frequent

808
00:47:43,596 --> 00:47:47,811
messages from people about ADHD.
I think it's in my Twitter

809
00:47:47,811 --> 00:47:50,630
profile and sometimes people will
just DM me and be like, I have

810
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:54,351
ADHD too. You know, and it's
often that like story of I was

811
00:47:54,356 --> 00:47:57,981
just diagnosed and exactly what
you were talking about at the

812
00:47:57,985 --> 00:48:01,070
beginning, Joe. It's the same
thing of not feeling alone, you

813
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:04,190
know? Because if you don't know
anybody else, or you're on this

814
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:07,911
journey, whatever journey it is
for the first time. you're

815
00:48:07,911 --> 00:48:11,090
setting out alone, and that feels
really lonely and overwhelming

816
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:15,141
sometimes. So if you have
somebody that's there who you can

817
00:48:15,141 --> 00:48:18,981
hear like, oh, I had that
experience. Oh yeah, I feel that

818
00:48:18,981 --> 00:48:21,981
way too. Somebody else feels that
way, then like suddenly you're

819
00:48:21,981 --> 00:48:24,800
not alone. Even if you don't know
this person and you're just

820
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,481
listening to them on the podcast.

821
00:48:26,846 --> 00:48:31,496
Joe: right? Yeah. Like yeah, it
is definitely scary when you

822
00:48:31,496 --> 00:48:34,315
first start up, but yeah, when
you kind of start to build up

823
00:48:34,315 --> 00:48:37,585
that little group of community,
it's not so bad.

824
00:48:38,449 --> 00:48:41,090
Bekah: Sorry. I looked at Dan and
I thought that Dan looked like he

825
00:48:41,090 --> 00:48:41,900
was gonna say something.

826
00:48:44,039 --> 00:48:50,969
Dan: I was having an idea. was
the, wasn't planning on saying it

827
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:51,119
out.

828
00:48:51,184 --> 00:48:53,855
Joe: idea where you start to it
to yourself first, and then

829
00:48:53,855 --> 00:48:55,385
you're like, alright, I can say
this out loud.

830
00:48:56,309 --> 00:49:00,869
Dan: uh oh, no. No. I, no, I was
just, uh, you know, being a

831
00:49:00,869 --> 00:49:04,670
developer with ADHD and like has
been, has been an interesting

832
00:49:04,675 --> 00:49:07,820
experience. My idea was having
like some sort of panel or

833
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:11,119
something like that, you know, or
a podcast episode or whatever

834
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:15,440
specifically about that. But it
wasn't a well formed idea and I

835
00:49:15,445 --> 00:49:18,019
wasn't really planning on saying
it out loud until Bekah forced me

836
00:49:18,019 --> 00:49:18,440
to, so,

837
00:49:19,835 --> 00:49:21,844
Bekah: we should definitely do
that. I think that would be

838
00:49:21,844 --> 00:49:23,824
really awesome. Um, where.

839
00:49:24,244 --> 00:49:26,224
Joe: that one you're gonna need
like a Zoom room so we can use

840
00:49:26,224 --> 00:49:27,244
that hand raise function,

841
00:49:27,795 --> 00:49:33,755
Bekah: Yeah, uh, we're at about
time anyway, and so we're gonna

842
00:49:33,784 --> 00:49:39,844
wrap up with my last question to
you, which was, what is one word

843
00:49:39,875 --> 00:49:41,405
that describes you?

844
00:49:43,385 --> 00:49:47,824
Joe: inquisitive. That was the
one I chose. Yes. Um, just

845
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:52,625
because like, I mean, through
about every career that I've had,

846
00:49:53,164 --> 00:49:56,195
my one thought was like, how can
I make this better?

847
00:49:56,894 --> 00:49:57,385
Bekah: Yeah,

848
00:49:57,514 --> 00:50:01,204
Joe: you know, like, how can I
improve upon this? Um, and that's

849
00:50:01,204 --> 00:50:04,925
kind of, I, I think that's kind
of what has led me to where I am

850
00:50:04,929 --> 00:50:09,394
right now is like, you know,
there, there's gotta be a way to

851
00:50:09,394 --> 00:50:13,085
automate this part. You know, I
would've automated answering the

852
00:50:13,085 --> 00:50:14,315
phone and talking to people if I
could have.

853
00:50:16,864 --> 00:50:19,295
Bekah: That's awesome and I think
that's a really good quality to

854
00:50:19,295 --> 00:50:22,954
have, um, and a great way to end
this episode. So thanks so much

855
00:50:22,954 --> 00:50:26,585

Joe, talking about your journey

experience about ADHD.
