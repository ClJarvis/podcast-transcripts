00:00:09,223 --> 00:00:11,342
Virtual Coffee Podcast. I'm
Bekah. And this is a podcast

3
00:00:11,342 --> 00:00:13,461
that

4
00:00:13,461 --> 00:00:17,452
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

5
00:00:17,452 --> 00:00:18,876
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of

6
00:00:18,876 --> 00:00:20,300
their

7
00:00:20,301 --> 00:00:23,271
coding journey. And they're here
on this podcast, sharing their

8
00:00:23,271 --> 00:00:24,891
stories and what they've
learned. And we're here to share

9
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:26,511
it with

10
00:00:26,512 --> 00:00:29,692
you here with me. Today is my
cohost Dan.

11
00:00:30,754 --> 00:00:34,325
Dan: Thanks Bekah. Today we're
joined by Todd Libby. Todd is a

12
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:37,804
web developer designer and
accessibility advocate. And he's

13
00:00:37,984 --> 00:00:41,104
been doing it for over 20 years.
He's currently an accessibility

14
00:00:41,104 --> 00:00:44,225
engineer at WebstaurantStore.
And he's also a member of the

15
00:00:44,225 --> 00:00:46,624
worldwide web consortium. Also
known as W3C, doing work

16
00:00:46,624 --> 00:00:49,023
updating

17
00:00:49,024 --> 00:00:53,104
their web content accessibility
guidelines. Todd also hosts a

18
00:00:53,104 --> 00:00:55,804
podcast called the Front End
Nerdery, so once you're done

19
00:00:55,804 --> 00:00:58,125
listening to this episode, head
over there and give that one a

20
00:00:58,145 --> 00:01:01,445
listen. We had a great time
talking with Todd and hearing

21
00:01:01,445 --> 00:01:02,839
about his long journey in tech,
how and why he developed a

22
00:01:02,839 --> 00:01:04,233
career

23
00:01:04,234 --> 00:01:07,685
focusing on accessibility and
shared with us about what

24
00:01:07,775 --> 00:01:10,685
accessibility means to him and
what kinds of things all

25
00:01:10,685 --> 00:01:12,814
developers can do to ensure
their work is accessible by

26
00:01:12,814 --> 00:01:14,943
everyone. I

27
00:01:14,944 --> 00:01:15,905
know you're going to enjoy it.

28
00:01:24,066 --> 00:01:26,676
Bekah: We start every episode of
the podcast. Like we start every

29
00:01:26,676 --> 00:01:30,605
Virtual Coffee. We introduce
ourselves with our name, where

30
00:01:30,605 --> 00:01:32,700
we're from, what we do and a
random check-in question.

31
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,795
Today's

32
00:01:34,816 --> 00:01:40,215
question is what famous artist,
dead or alive, or you want to

33
00:01:40,215 --> 00:01:45,813
paint your portrait. We hope you
enjoy this episode. name is

34
00:01:45,813 --> 00:01:49,575
Bekah. I am a front end
developer from a small town in

35
00:01:49,575 --> 00:01:53,337
Ohio, and if

36
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:57,509
I could have one person paint my
portrait, I, when I was in

37
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:59,684
college, Georgia, there was like
big Georgia O'Keeffe paintings

38
00:01:59,684 --> 00:02:01,769
or

39
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:06,478
replicas in the hallways of my
department. And I always loved

40
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:09,143
them. I know that's not what she
doesn't paint people, but I

41
00:02:09,143 --> 00:02:11,808
think

42
00:02:11,808 --> 00:02:16,038
it would be cool to see how I
would be represented by her. So

43
00:02:16,188 --> 00:02:17,329
I'm going to go with Georgia
O'Keeffe

44
00:02:19,144 --> 00:02:21,573
Dan: Um, hi, I'm Dan I'm a front
end developer in Cleveland,

45
00:02:21,573 --> 00:02:24,002
Ohio,

46
00:02:24,093 --> 00:02:27,693
and, um, does it have to be
famous person?

47
00:02:27,693 --> 00:02:28,463
Bekah: Did I say famous?

48
00:02:28,463 --> 00:02:29,403
Dan: I, it said famous in the
question.

49
00:02:29,433 --> 00:02:30,968
Bekah: I did. but now like just
take it out.

50
00:02:31,354 --> 00:02:33,393
Dan: I mean, uh, Kate, one of my
good friends at Kate Brideau

51
00:02:33,393 --> 00:02:35,432
from

52
00:02:35,433 --> 00:02:39,033
college, um, I would say that
would be the person. Um, that'd

53
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:42,213
be famous. I don't, I don't
really know a lot of famous

54
00:02:42,943 --> 00:02:44,303
names. I mean, except for like
the really famous ones, you

55
00:02:44,303 --> 00:02:45,663
know,

56
00:02:45,693 --> 00:02:50,503
and that seems like a boring
answer. Um, maybe have Raphael,

57
00:02:50,524 --> 00:02:52,743
but not the, not the artist that
ninja turtle.

58
00:02:53,614 --> 00:02:54,204
Bekah: Or my

59
00:02:55,324 --> 00:02:58,644
Dan: Yeah. Well it's well, sure.
There's there's that too. Yeah.

60
00:02:58,683 --> 00:03:00,443
Any Raphael really? I'll take,
uh, take any version. Sounds

61
00:03:00,443 --> 00:03:02,203
like

62
00:03:02,204 --> 00:03:02,743
a good choice.

63
00:03:05,588 --> 00:03:09,818
Todd: And I'm Todd Libby. I am a
front end developer and

64
00:03:09,818 --> 00:03:15,968
accessibility engineer currently
in Phoenix, Arizona. And I guess

65
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:25,429
my artist would be, I dunno, he
was really unique. So I guess I

66
00:03:25,429 --> 00:03:27,868
would say Salvador Dali.

67
00:03:28,899 --> 00:03:29,519
Bekah: That's cool.

68
00:03:29,718 --> 00:03:30,258
Dan: That'd be a good one.

69
00:03:31,449 --> 00:03:32,853
Bekah: There's um, anytime
somebody is from Phoenix, I

70
00:03:32,853 --> 00:03:34,257
think

71
00:03:34,258 --> 00:03:36,268
of a short story that I read
from Sherman Alexie. This is

72
00:03:36,268 --> 00:03:38,278
what it

73
00:03:38,278 --> 00:03:41,998
means to say Phoenix, Arizona.
And I remember nothing about the

74
00:03:41,998 --> 00:03:43,618
short story except for the
title. And it's just

75
00:03:43,618 --> 00:03:45,238
automatically,

76
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:49,679
that's my mind. So if you
haven't, read it, check it out

77
00:03:49,679 --> 00:03:51,179
and then remind me what it was
about.

78
00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:55,028
Todd: I haven't, but I will look
that up. Definitely. I'm

79
00:03:55,028 --> 00:03:58,688
originally from Portland Maine.
So of course everybody knows me

80
00:03:58,688 --> 00:04:00,549
because of the lobster roll
thing. So.

81
00:04:01,554 --> 00:04:05,514
Bekah: Yes, Todd is all about
the lobsters and in our Virtual

82
00:04:05,514 --> 00:04:10,883
Coffee Slack, he always uses the
lobster emoji to respond to

83
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:12,608
people. And so we just
automatically recognize that

84
00:04:12,608 --> 00:04:14,333
it's

85
00:04:14,334 --> 00:04:18,444
Todd. So it's like he, he has
claimed that emoji and it's one

86
00:04:18,444 --> 00:04:19,553
of the greatest things ever.

87
00:04:20,303 --> 00:04:22,803
Dan: It's really cool. And it's
just like, you see the lobster

88
00:04:22,803 --> 00:04:24,394
emoji pop up. You're like, oh,
cool. Todd's here.

89
00:04:26,093 --> 00:04:28,255
Bekah: I just think it's it's
funny, like when, when new

90
00:04:28,255 --> 00:04:30,417
people

91
00:04:30,418 --> 00:04:33,538
come into Virtual Coffee and
then they also click the lobster

92
00:04:33,538 --> 00:04:34,069
emoji. So.

93
00:04:34,069 --> 00:04:36,749
Dan: I mean I always click it. I
mean, I don't first, you know

94
00:04:36,749 --> 00:04:37,963
what I mean? But like, um, it's,
it's like high five and Todd,

95
00:04:37,963 --> 00:04:39,177
you

96
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:43,559
know, it's like celebrating the
Toddness of it.

97
00:04:44,363 --> 00:04:46,343
Todd: the virtual virtual high
five,

98
00:04:46,798 --> 00:04:47,459
Dan: That's right.

99
00:04:47,848 --> 00:04:48,983
Bekah: Right. And it can be
about all sorts of different

100
00:04:48,983 --> 00:04:50,118
things.

101
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:51,874
Like somebody could post a
question that they have, and

102
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:53,629
then

103
00:04:53,629 --> 00:04:56,869
like, there's a lobster emoji.
It's not about lobster. Although

104
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,059
if I had a question about
lobster, I would definitely ask

105
00:04:59,059 --> 00:04:59,658
Todd first.

106
00:05:02,963 --> 00:05:04,494
Todd: I've got a million no one
answers.

107
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:08,048
Bekah: I feel like that's a
separate podcast episode.

108
00:05:08,048 --> 00:05:08,168
Todd: Yes.

109
00:05:08,209 --> 00:05:09,189
Dan: Does it have to be though?

110
00:05:09,548 --> 00:05:13,968
Bekah: Thank you so much for
being here with us. Todd, we

111
00:05:14,358 --> 00:05:18,559
always like to start with the
origin story. How did you get to

112
00:05:18,588 --> 00:05:20,403
where you are today? So if you.
want to take us through that

113
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,218
path

114
00:05:22,309 --> 00:05:22,488
would be.

115
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:27,173
Todd: Yeah. Oh boy. That's a
long one. Um, I'll give you the

116
00:05:27,173 --> 00:05:32,824
abridged version. I'm nine years
old. I started on a Commodore

117
00:05:32,824 --> 00:05:38,463
PET. Um, in school and then
gradually worked my way up to a

118
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:43,233
Commodore 64, where I learned
BASIC a lot of different flavors

119
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:50,343
of BASIC, um, and was just, you
know, it was just a hobby of

120
00:05:50,343 --> 00:05:55,803
course at that point. But, um,
what was it about 1999? Um, I

121
00:05:55,803 --> 00:06:01,263
had

122
00:06:01,264 --> 00:06:09,139
a. What was it? A 386 desktop,
IBM computer. And I started to

123
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:12,153
learn HTML and this was before
CSS. So that is the indication

124
00:06:12,153 --> 00:06:15,167
of

125
00:06:15,168 --> 00:06:23,178
how old I am and JavaScript was
just kicking around. Um, I

126
00:06:23,178 --> 00:06:25,323
started learning how to design
websites using Front Page

127
00:06:25,323 --> 00:06:27,468
Express

128
00:06:27,499 --> 00:06:35,103
in Internet Explorer, three and
four. And just, it went from

129
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:44,733
there. Um, programming was cool.
I used to do, um, in BASIC on a

130
00:06:44,733 --> 00:06:49,564
Commodore I would program. If
anybody remembers those, choose

131
00:06:49,564 --> 00:06:52,009
your own adventure books from
way back in the day. I, I used

132
00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:54,454
to

133
00:06:54,454 --> 00:07:01,863
program a text-based, uh, Pretty
much copied and I hope no one's

134
00:07:01,863 --> 00:07:04,938
listening from that company,
but, um, I, I used to, just to

135
00:07:04,938 --> 00:07:08,013
just

136
00:07:08,014 --> 00:07:13,399
practice, I would just. Code
those books into a, into a

137
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:18,468
text-based game on Commodore 64.
And that's really what got me

138
00:07:18,468 --> 00:07:22,249
started because I was living in
a very rural area in, in New

139
00:07:22,249 --> 00:07:28,009
England. And, uh, there wasn't
much to do so except for

140
00:07:28,038 --> 00:07:34,488
programming at that point. So
skip ahead to today, or when I

141
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:40,548
started professionally and I was
22 years ago. And I started, um,

142
00:07:41,538 --> 00:07:44,689
I read Jeffrey Zeldman his book,
Designing with Web Standards

143
00:07:45,168 --> 00:07:49,788
instantly got hooked into web
standards, uh, progressive

144
00:07:49,788 --> 00:07:52,038
enhancement accessibility. And
it just, you know, took off to

145
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:54,288
the

146
00:07:54,288 --> 00:07:59,449
point where it is today, where
I'm in the field that I enjoy

147
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:01,478
being in, and that's
accessibility.

148
00:08:04,269 --> 00:08:07,298
Dan: I think that's awesome. I,
and I, I love that book too. And

149
00:08:08,499 --> 00:08:14,829
Zeldman I have been, um, so 22
years ago what, 99, 2000

150
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:19,478
something like that, know? And I
think I got into, I mean, I was

151
00:08:19,478 --> 00:08:21,748
starting to make something
around then and really. Got a

152
00:08:21,748 --> 00:08:24,018
lot more

153
00:08:24,019 --> 00:08:27,588
into it a couple of years later.
Um, but was with the web

154
00:08:27,588 --> 00:08:28,713
standards, you know, movement
and everything like that. And

155
00:08:28,713 --> 00:08:29,838
I've

156
00:08:29,838 --> 00:08:31,953
been, uh, you know, and
similarly front-end focused for

157
00:08:31,953 --> 00:08:34,068
a long

158
00:08:34,068 --> 00:08:35,463
time. And, um, one of us was
just one of the reasons I was

159
00:08:35,463 --> 00:08:36,858
very

160
00:08:36,859 --> 00:08:38,943
excited to have you podcast and
to kind of get to get to hang

161
00:08:38,943 --> 00:08:41,027
out

162
00:08:41,028 --> 00:08:42,288
with a little bit more. Um,

163
00:08:42,318 --> 00:08:42,438
Todd: Yeah.

164
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:49,428
Dan: It's uh, so, know, on front
end and focusing on

165
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:54,303
accessibility, um, things like
that. I mean, what career

166
00:08:54,303 --> 00:08:56,313
opportunities has that like
presented you from, you know,

167
00:08:56,313 --> 00:08:59,073
starting, you don't need to like
list every single one or

168
00:08:59,073 --> 00:09:01,433
whatever, but like run, run us
through a little bit of how

169
00:09:01,443 --> 00:09:03,888
that's been being like, uh,
front end and accessibility, you

170
00:09:03,888 --> 00:09:06,333
know,

171
00:09:06,364 --> 00:09:08,734
a specialist, um, for whatever
that means for you. Uh, you

172
00:09:08,734 --> 00:09:11,104
know,

173
00:09:11,124 --> 00:09:12,163
run it through a little bit,
like how that's been finding,

174
00:09:12,163 --> 00:09:13,202
finding

175
00:09:13,744 --> 00:09:14,973
work and finding people that
care about that sort of thing.

176
00:09:14,973 --> 00:09:16,202
Um,

177
00:09:16,869 --> 00:09:18,564
Bekah: Can I just jump into, if
you can just provide some

178
00:09:18,564 --> 00:09:20,259
context

179
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:22,764
for what, what does
accessibility mean and how does

180
00:09:22,764 --> 00:09:25,269
that work as

181
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:26,048
part of a job?

182
00:09:27,379 --> 00:09:30,244
Todd: Okay. Um, to address what
it's accessibility mean, uh,

183
00:09:30,244 --> 00:09:33,109
I'll

184
00:09:33,109 --> 00:09:38,708
address that first and that is
making the web equal and

185
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:42,634
accessible for everybody. Um, it
just doesn't have to be a

186
00:09:42,634 --> 00:09:44,989
disability. It can be, you know,
somebody in I'll use this

187
00:09:44,989 --> 00:09:47,344
example

188
00:09:47,673 --> 00:09:50,763
in a very rural area who has a
3g phone. And, you know, it's

189
00:09:50,763 --> 00:09:53,853
not a

190
00:09:53,854 --> 00:09:57,484
very fast connection is to, you
know, what we have these days

191
00:09:57,484 --> 00:10:04,714
with our shiny new iPhones and
stuff like that. Um, and then

192
00:10:04,714 --> 00:10:10,188
accessibility. Somebody in
accessibility would basically,

193
00:10:10,278 --> 00:10:16,038
um, not only advocate, but don't
in my daily routine of doing

194
00:10:16,068 --> 00:10:19,353
auditing on websites. It's just
checking to see if, uh, Sites

195
00:10:19,353 --> 00:10:22,638
are

196
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:27,619
accessible if they're, you know,
if they should be failing, um,

197
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:32,239
web content, accessibility
guidelines WCAG is how I

198
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,843
pronounce it. There's many
different pronunciations to

199
00:10:33,843 --> 00:10:35,388
that,

200
00:10:35,389 --> 00:10:46,489
but, um, um, the, um, you know,
and you know, there's different,

201
00:10:46,489 --> 00:10:50,619
I guess. Levels of how people
will do an audit. Like, you

202
00:10:50,619 --> 00:10:54,749
know,

203
00:10:55,558 --> 00:10:58,048
you can do, you know, a and AA
as far as the levels. So there's

204
00:10:58,048 --> 00:11:00,538
a

205
00:11:00,568 --> 00:11:06,058
AA and AAA, a lot of people I
find don't do AAA, because it's

206
00:11:06,058 --> 00:11:08,593
too stringent and it's also, you
don't have to go that far in

207
00:11:08,593 --> 00:11:11,128
most

208
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:17,224
cases. Um, but. It's just
auditing, making sure sites are

209
00:11:17,224 --> 00:11:22,984
accessible in, um, creating a
report for a client and then

210
00:11:23,043 --> 00:11:25,098
telling them here's what's
wrong. Here's how you need to

211
00:11:25,098 --> 00:11:27,153
fix it.

212
00:11:27,214 --> 00:11:32,553
This doesn't, you know, adhere
to the guidelines and, um,

213
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:37,803
recommendations for best
practices as well. And, um, You

214
00:11:37,803 --> 00:11:40,953
know, looking at code and, you
know, always looking at HTML and

215
00:11:40,953 --> 00:11:46,594
CSS because CSS too has a strong
effect on accessibility and, uh,

216
00:11:47,043 --> 00:11:51,464
that's what the job entails. Um,
and Dan, what was your question?

217
00:11:52,369 --> 00:11:53,463
Dan: Alright, I guess my
question was, um, you know,

218
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:54,557
it's, it's a

219
00:11:54,558 --> 00:11:57,568
sort of. I don't know if
non-traditional is the right

220
00:11:57,568 --> 00:12:01,019
word, but, you know, being a
specialist really in any regard,

221
00:12:01,078 --> 00:12:03,163
um, is, uh, is a choice, you
know, and can limit your

222
00:12:03,163 --> 00:12:05,248
options,

223
00:12:05,249 --> 00:12:09,208
but like also what you want to
do. Right. Um, and so I, my

224
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:13,048
question was more like, how has
it been, uh, on your career

225
00:12:13,048 --> 00:12:15,568
journey? You know, being a
specialist, especially in the

226
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,948
accessibility world,

227
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:22,543
Todd: Right. Um, it's been a
challenge lately in, I would say

228
00:12:22,543 --> 00:12:30,793
the past. Five, maybe 10 years.
Um, because not a lot of people,

229
00:12:30,793 --> 00:12:33,464
not a lot of companies were
looking for accessibility

230
00:12:33,464 --> 00:12:39,764
specialists. Um, not until I've
pretty much noticed this year. A

231
00:12:39,764 --> 00:12:43,333
lot of companies are now looking
for accessibility specialists

232
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:47,668
because companies are getting
sued. And they don't want to get

233
00:12:47,668 --> 00:12:53,908
sued. That's that's the bottom
line. So my professional journey

234
00:12:53,908 --> 00:13:00,239
had been, I worked, uh, I
started, I did a website for

235
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:07,769
somebody I knew back in, uh, new
England, Maine. And, um, it was

236
00:13:07,769 --> 00:13:10,288
just a small. And then from
there I got, you know, a few

237
00:13:10,288 --> 00:13:12,807
different

238
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:16,859
jobs doing websites. And then
from there I was like, well, you

239
00:13:16,859 --> 00:13:18,794
know, this thing's taken off.
I'm going to do the I'm going to

240
00:13:18,794 --> 00:13:20,729
go

241
00:13:20,739 --> 00:13:26,321
the freelance route. So that's
what I did. And. Up until 2015,

242
00:13:26,321 --> 00:13:31,903
I

243
00:13:31,903 --> 00:13:36,644
was a freelance, uh, developer,
I guess you could say I got into

244
00:13:36,644 --> 00:13:42,313
WordPress, uh, PHP development.
And then, um, I was hired by a

245
00:13:42,313 --> 00:13:51,403
company to do their website and
their SAS, um, their SAS, uh,

246
00:13:52,663 --> 00:14:01,124
site, I guess. It was a, a thing
where you log in and it wasn't a

247
00:14:01,124 --> 00:14:06,583
public facing site. And, um,
from there it would be been

248
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:12,042
about, I

249
00:14:12,043 --> 00:14:14,368
don't know. I think I counted
over 2000 resumes that I had

250
00:14:14,368 --> 00:14:16,693
sent

251
00:14:16,693 --> 00:14:23,323
out to companies in 20 years in.
One company hired me. And that

252
00:14:23,323 --> 00:14:28,994
was that company that I worked
for in 2015 to, uh, just, uh,

253
00:14:29,024 --> 00:14:34,033
last year as a matter of fact.
And then finally somebody took a

254
00:14:34,033 --> 00:14:36,823
chance on me that would have
been Nobility. I was hired by

255
00:14:36,823 --> 00:14:43,903
Nobility, uh, in March and March
or April. Geez, it's been over

256
00:14:43,903 --> 00:14:46,033
six months, but, um,

257
00:14:46,889 --> 00:14:47,818
Dan: What is time anyway.

258
00:14:48,418 --> 00:14:51,359
Todd: well, I don't even know
anymore. I'm in a different time

259
00:14:51,359 --> 00:14:57,928
zone now, so that's messed me up
too. Uh, but no ability gave me

260
00:14:57,928 --> 00:15:02,458
a, you know, an opportunity and
very grateful for that

261
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:09,178
opportunity with them and, um, a
lot of great people in Nobility

262
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:12,238
that work for the company. Um,
everybody is a matter of fact

263
00:15:12,238 --> 00:15:15,268
and

264
00:15:15,298 --> 00:15:17,578
they do some really good stuff
as far as accessibility goes.

265
00:15:17,578 --> 00:15:19,858
And,

266
00:15:19,918 --> 00:15:24,127
um, as of October 1st, I will
be, um, on the, uh,

267
00:15:24,127 --> 00:15:28,336
WebstaurantStore

268
00:15:28,466 --> 00:15:32,677
team as an accessibility
engineer. Uh, so I look forward

269
00:15:32,677 --> 00:15:34,366
to that. Yeah.

270
00:15:34,866 --> 00:15:37,506
Bekah: Can you talk a little bit
about what you'll be doing in

271
00:15:37,506 --> 00:15:39,756
that role there? Maybe dive into
a little bit of detail.

272
00:15:41,871 --> 00:15:46,251
Todd: Um, for right now, all I
know is it's basically doing the

273
00:15:46,251 --> 00:15:52,192
same thing I do now and that's
auditing, um, their product for

274
00:15:52,192 --> 00:16:04,251
their, uh, website. I know they
use, they use react and I think

275
00:16:04,282 --> 00:16:10,042
it was .net. So that I'll be in
that, um, environment.

276
00:16:10,782 --> 00:16:13,182
Bekah: So like when you do an
audit, where do you start with

277
00:16:13,182 --> 00:16:13,272
that?

278
00:16:14,961 --> 00:16:18,216
Todd: So when I do an audit, I
do automated, uh, checks and

279
00:16:18,216 --> 00:16:21,471
scans

280
00:16:21,471 --> 00:16:27,772
first. So I use stuff like the
WAVE extension, um, the axe, I

281
00:16:28,131 --> 00:16:32,601
now wait until the end to use
the axe-core extension in the

282
00:16:32,601 --> 00:16:40,297
browser. Um, Things like, uh,
there's a command line called

283
00:16:40,297 --> 00:16:48,726
Pa11y. So it's PA one, one Y uh,
there's that I use, um, does

284
00:16:48,756 --> 00:16:55,057
Bookmarklets from Ian Lloyd and
Paul J. Adam that I use to also

285
00:16:55,326 --> 00:17:01,206
do checks. Um, Let's see what
else? There's Microsoft

286
00:17:01,236 --> 00:17:07,267
Accessibility Insights, which is
a great tool to use. Um, what

287
00:17:07,267 --> 00:17:15,517
else? And I said, axe, color,
contrast checks. I use, um, the

288
00:17:15,517 --> 00:17:19,626
Firefox accessibility dev tools,
the accessibility panels and

289
00:17:19,626 --> 00:17:22,911
those, and then I move on to,
um, manual testing. So. mouse

290
00:17:22,911 --> 00:17:26,196
only,

291
00:17:26,961 --> 00:17:33,112
um, keyboard only I will do it,
which goes back to color

292
00:17:33,112 --> 00:17:35,842
contrast. I'll do the squint
test. So I'll just look at the

293
00:17:35,842 --> 00:17:39,352
site while I'm squinting at it
and see if, you know, I can make

294
00:17:39,352 --> 00:17:45,951
out anything cause that I was
taught not too long ago. So, um,

295
00:17:46,551 --> 00:17:52,701
and uh, screen readers, I will
use screen readers. So for Mac

296
00:17:52,701 --> 00:17:58,192
there's Voiceover. And it's best
to use Voiceover in Safari

297
00:17:58,221 --> 00:18:01,686
because the native, you know,
Mac app and everything, um, and

298
00:18:01,686 --> 00:18:05,151
VDA

299
00:18:05,332 --> 00:18:10,071
and Jaws on a Windows. And, um,
if, and it's very, very rare,

300
00:18:10,071 --> 00:18:14,810
but

301
00:18:14,811 --> 00:18:21,067
if somebody says, oh, you know,
we have Linux users. So I will

302
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:24,456
test on what it's called Orca
for Linux and, um, yeah, those

303
00:18:24,456 --> 00:18:27,845
are

304
00:18:27,846 --> 00:18:31,041
pretty much, uh, if I remember
them all correctly, um, those

305
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:34,236
are

306
00:18:34,237 --> 00:18:35,317
the tools I use.

307
00:18:36,207 --> 00:18:38,366
Dan: That's. Yeah, that's
awesome. It's very extensive. I

308
00:18:38,366 --> 00:18:39,926
was just writing all them down
so that

309
00:18:39,997 --> 00:18:42,176
Bekah: So as I well, the link to
those show notes.

310
00:18:42,471 --> 00:18:44,136
Dan: Yeah, absolutely. And so,
so like day to day, I mean, I

311
00:18:44,136 --> 00:18:45,801
know

312
00:18:45,801 --> 00:18:47,661
you haven't started yet, but
like in your, in your role, will

313
00:18:47,661 --> 00:18:49,521
it be

314
00:18:49,882 --> 00:18:53,541
mostly doing audits after the
fact? Or like, will you be

315
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:54,876
interfacing with, you know, I'm
not sure what they do, what

316
00:18:54,876 --> 00:18:56,211
they,

317
00:18:56,241 --> 00:18:59,092
what, what they make or anything
like that, but you know, like

318
00:18:59,092 --> 00:19:03,142
where in the process are you,
are you, uh, doing like

319
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:06,336
accessibility? Uh, you know,
helping the team with, with this

320
00:19:06,336 --> 00:19:10,446
stuff, like, know, audits for me
imply, and I know this isn't

321
00:19:10,446 --> 00:19:13,537
always true, but when I think of
it as something, oh, something's

322
00:19:13,537 --> 00:19:16,807
done, now we do an audit on it.
You know what I mean? but I was

323
00:19:16,807 --> 00:19:18,936
wondering if, and I'm sure
that's an important part. I was

324
00:19:18,936 --> 00:19:21,066
wondering if there's, um, places
earlier in the process where,

325
00:19:21,066 --> 00:19:23,196
um,

326
00:19:23,886 --> 00:19:28,386
where, you know, you're able to
interface and like, you know,

327
00:19:28,866 --> 00:19:31,747
make suggestions before it, you
know, as opposed to like fixing

328
00:19:31,747 --> 00:19:34,576
things, but like help build
something you know, the first

329
00:19:34,576 --> 00:19:34,666
time.

330
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:34,997
Todd: Right. Yeah,

331
00:19:35,017 --> 00:19:35,696
Dan: Does that make sense?

332
00:19:36,277 --> 00:19:42,946
Todd: yeah, yeah. Um, I'm, I'm
sure it's going to be probably a

333
00:19:42,946 --> 00:19:49,096
lot of both. Um, maybe there's
existing things on the site, uh,

334
00:19:49,636 --> 00:19:56,416
that need to be checked, um,
components that may be being

335
00:19:56,416 --> 00:20:00,561
worked on. We'll have to be
checked. I mean, it's that way,

336
00:20:00,561 --> 00:20:02,646
pretty much with any kind of
audit. So I've had companies

337
00:20:02,646 --> 00:20:04,731
come

338
00:20:04,741 --> 00:20:07,946
to me and say, you know, we
we've got somebody who emailed

339
00:20:07,946 --> 00:20:11,151
us and

340
00:20:11,152 --> 00:20:13,806
said, this isn't accessible, so
we need a, an audit done and

341
00:20:13,806 --> 00:20:16,460
I'll

342
00:20:16,461 --> 00:20:20,287
go through the site and say,
okay, I found all this. Here's

343
00:20:20,287 --> 00:20:24,757
what you need to do to fix it.
They'll fix it. That'll be after

344
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:28,146
the fact of course, I've had
companies come in and ask me to

345
00:20:28,146 --> 00:20:31,386
do consulting with their teams
before the project starts to

346
00:20:31,386 --> 00:20:34,626
make

347
00:20:34,626 --> 00:20:37,567
sure that it gets done
beforehand. Because when you do

348
00:20:37,567 --> 00:20:40,836
an accessibility, when you, when
you bring in accessibility from

349
00:20:40,836 --> 00:20:45,146
the start of a project, it's so
much easier and there's less, a

350
00:20:45,146 --> 00:20:50,416
lot less stress, doing it from
the very beginning, because when

351
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:53,957
you get to the end and you've
got, everything is as accessible

352
00:20:53,957 --> 00:20:58,336
as you can. And I'll add that
nothing's a hundred percent

353
00:20:58,336 --> 00:21:05,537
accessible. Um, it's, it's a lot
easier on your teams. You know,

354
00:21:05,567 --> 00:21:06,812
like I said, there's a lot less
stress. You don't have to go

355
00:21:06,812 --> 00:21:08,057
back

356
00:21:08,057 --> 00:21:13,237
and scatter around trying to fix
this, that, and the other thing

357
00:21:13,656 --> 00:21:17,826
after the fact. So, um, and
that's also where my advocacy

358
00:21:17,826 --> 00:21:22,086
comes in is saying, okay, if you
get this done from the start,

359
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:24,741
you're going to be, it's going
to be so much easier and it's

360
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:26,616
going

361
00:21:26,616 --> 00:21:28,866
to cost less money because
you're not going to. It's going

362
00:21:28,866 --> 00:21:31,116
to cause

363
00:21:31,446 --> 00:21:33,426
a lot less stress again. And,
uh, those are the two main

364
00:21:33,426 --> 00:21:35,406
things.

365
00:21:35,767 --> 00:21:39,126
Um, but to answer the question,
it's going to be a little bit of

366
00:21:39,126 --> 00:21:40,746
both. I would think, because
like I said, it's usually that

367
00:21:40,746 --> 00:21:42,366
way at

368
00:21:42,366 --> 00:21:45,906
the beginning, you know? Um,

369
00:21:45,906 --> 00:21:47,346
Dan: Get something to a baseline
first.

370
00:21:47,366 --> 00:21:51,807
Todd: Yeah. Yeah. And, and, and
it's still really early in the

371
00:21:51,807 --> 00:21:54,687
process, so I'm not too sure,
but I know that there'll be a

372
00:21:54,687 --> 00:21:57,567
lot of,

373
00:21:57,626 --> 00:22:00,746
you know, checking to make sure
everything's good. On the end

374
00:22:00,746 --> 00:22:03,866
of,

375
00:22:04,346 --> 00:22:07,047
you know, before we put this
out, we need to make sure it's

376
00:22:07,047 --> 00:22:09,416
accessible. So. yeah.

377
00:22:10,311 --> 00:22:12,051
Bekah: As you've been working
through this industry, do you

378
00:22:12,051 --> 00:22:18,307
think. Is there one problem that
you keep encountering over and

379
00:22:18,307 --> 00:22:22,356
over, like stand out issues,
things that people can just

380
00:22:22,356 --> 00:22:25,656
really look at and say, all
right, let's start here.

381
00:22:26,352 --> 00:22:34,511
Todd: Well, where do I begin?
It's it's a lot, but mainly it's

382
00:22:34,511 --> 00:22:42,311
color contrast. Okay. Um, that's
the biggest one. Um, and, uh,

383
00:22:43,846 --> 00:22:46,666
Keyboard accessibility is
another and throwing a third

384
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:49,486
one. And

385
00:22:49,487 --> 00:22:52,352
that being, uh, alt text on
images, the alternative text,

386
00:22:52,352 --> 00:22:55,217
um,

387
00:22:56,537 --> 00:23:07,217
I've had, you know, a lot of alt
text can be a tricky, um, uh, a

388
00:23:07,217 --> 00:23:11,747
tricky thing because people
think, well, I have this image.

389
00:23:12,817 --> 00:23:19,477
And I need to really go into
detail what that image is

390
00:23:19,477 --> 00:23:21,711
conveying. If it's an
informative image and you really

391
00:23:21,711 --> 00:23:23,945
don't just a

392
00:23:23,946 --> 00:23:31,146
short, you know, it's a purple
flower in a field, um, is fine.

393
00:23:31,146 --> 00:23:33,546
You don't have to go into, I've
seen on Twitter because they

394
00:23:33,546 --> 00:23:35,946
give

395
00:23:35,946 --> 00:23:38,218
you a thousand characters for
alt text. And I've seen this.

396
00:23:38,218 --> 00:23:40,490
I've

397
00:23:40,491 --> 00:23:41,892
seen alt text that long before.

398
00:23:42,031 --> 00:23:43,771
Bekah: I always wonder, like, I,
I don't think I've written

399
00:23:43,771 --> 00:23:45,511
enough

400
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:47,311
because I'm not even close to
the 1000 and I have a thousand

401
00:23:47,311 --> 00:23:49,081
to

402
00:23:49,082 --> 00:23:49,531
write.

403
00:23:49,696 --> 00:23:51,766
Dan: Yeah. I always try to just
like, like, just say the joker.

404
00:23:51,766 --> 00:23:53,836
I

405
00:23:53,836 --> 00:23:54,961
mean, usually if I'm posting an
image, it's a joke, you know,

406
00:23:54,961 --> 00:23:56,086
but

407
00:23:56,086 --> 00:24:00,136
like the shortest version of the
joke is, you know, so I like

408
00:24:00,136 --> 00:24:03,287
posted one today and it was just
like guys saying thumbs up or

409
00:24:03,287 --> 00:24:05,267
something like that, that, you
know, you know what I mean? like

410
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:07,111
that seems that at least seems
like usually enough. I don't

411
00:24:07,111 --> 00:24:08,806
need

412
00:24:08,807 --> 00:24:09,436
to give the whole,

413
00:24:09,557 --> 00:24:11,656
Bekah: Sometimes I just don't
post because I don't know how to

414
00:24:11,656 --> 00:24:15,856
describe it. Like, well, I'm not
really sure that I know how to

415
00:24:15,856 --> 00:24:19,336
say capture what this is doing,
so we'll go, we'll go for

416
00:24:19,336 --> 00:24:19,936
something else.

417
00:24:20,767 --> 00:24:24,297
Todd: There's a lot of debate
around how long should it be? It

418
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:27,116
shouldn't be 180 characters.
Should it be a certain amount of

419
00:24:27,116 --> 00:24:31,646
words, but just as long as it
conveys in a short succinct,

420
00:24:32,636 --> 00:24:39,086
Sentence, I guess that's fine.
Um, and of course you have some

421
00:24:39,176 --> 00:24:43,287
images decorative that, ya know,
it needs an empty all text. And

422
00:24:43,287 --> 00:24:47,876
that's a big one because I was
just doing an audit and they had

423
00:24:47,876 --> 00:24:53,547
decorative images, but no, alt,
no empty alt text, um, which is

424
00:24:53,547 --> 00:24:57,326
just the alt equals, you know,
quotes and it's, the quotes are

425
00:24:57,326 --> 00:24:58,346
empty in between,

426
00:24:58,961 --> 00:25:01,781
Bekah: Can you explain that?
Cause that I had just recently

427
00:25:01,781 --> 00:25:06,892
learned about that, but. Don't
quite understand why that's the

428
00:25:06,892 --> 00:25:07,471
standard.

429
00:25:08,172 --> 00:25:11,757
Todd: So there's a, it tells a
screen reader. There's an image

430
00:25:11,757 --> 00:25:14,081
there, but it doesn't, it
doesn't need it's decorative

431
00:25:14,081 --> 00:25:16,405
basically.

432
00:25:16,406 --> 00:25:19,237
So it just there's, there's no
need to, to

433
00:25:19,636 --> 00:25:22,426
Dan: ha what happens in a
screenwriter? If it runs into an

434
00:25:22,426 --> 00:25:24,257
image with no alt attribute at
all?

435
00:25:25,297 --> 00:25:29,797
Todd: Uh, it skips over it. So
you're loo the, the user is

436
00:25:29,797 --> 00:25:31,326
losing information. So if
there's something you're trying

437
00:25:31,326 --> 00:25:32,855
to

438
00:25:32,856 --> 00:25:37,567
convey, like let's use the, um,
like, an infographic, for

439
00:25:37,656 --> 00:25:40,491
example, and there's no alt text
on it. That user that's using

440
00:25:40,491 --> 00:25:43,326
the

441
00:25:43,326 --> 00:25:47,356
screen reader is not gonna know
that it's there.

442
00:25:47,997 --> 00:25:52,836
Dan: Totally. Totally. And so in
the case of a decorative image

443
00:25:52,866 --> 00:25:56,317
where we don't need. It's okay.
If his screen, you know, if it's

444
00:25:56,317 --> 00:25:59,227
okay, if anybody skips over it,
what do you know, what is the

445
00:25:59,227 --> 00:26:01,446
tactical difference for a screen
reader for a user on a screen

446
00:26:01,446 --> 00:26:07,326
reader between empty, an image
with an like with a alt property

447
00:26:07,326 --> 00:26:12,727
and just an empty string and an
image with alt you know, defined

448
00:26:12,727 --> 00:26:13,086
at all.

449
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:24,866
Todd: So. it's okay. Let's use a
logo. As an example, if you have

450
00:26:25,287 --> 00:26:31,257
empty alt text on your logo, and
it's also linked, the screen

451
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:39,116
reader will read that link and
you don't want that to read it.

452
00:26:39,326 --> 00:26:45,382
You don't want it to. It doesn't
really need to, I mean, there's

453
00:26:45,382 --> 00:26:51,352
cases where somebody may say,
yeah, I want the person to know

454
00:26:51,352 --> 00:26:53,901
what the logo looks like, but if
it's not really necessary, um,

455
00:26:53,901 --> 00:26:56,450
no

456
00:26:56,451 --> 00:27:04,342
alt text, you know, it's the
screen reader. Won't read

457
00:27:04,342 --> 00:27:07,994
anything and. As far as I know.
And I'll be the first to say,

458
00:27:07,994 --> 00:27:11,646
I'm

459
00:27:11,646 --> 00:27:13,986
not an expert by any means with
screen readers, because this is

460
00:27:13,986 --> 00:27:16,326
a

461
00:27:16,326 --> 00:27:19,836
lot of different stuff. I've
been learning lately, but to

462
00:27:19,836 --> 00:27:23,346
mine, to

463
00:27:23,346 --> 00:27:30,096
my recollection, anyways, an
empty. So the end. So no alt

464
00:27:30,096 --> 00:27:35,872
texts. Let me get this straight.
No, alt text, the URL will be

465
00:27:35,872 --> 00:27:37,311
read to the image.

466
00:27:39,307 --> 00:27:40,507
Dan: Okay. Yeah. That's the big
difference. All right. That's

467
00:27:40,507 --> 00:27:41,707
the

468
00:27:41,707 --> 00:27:42,126
part, I didn't

469
00:27:42,422 --> 00:27:43,321
Todd: Yes. Yup.

470
00:27:43,356 --> 00:27:48,547
Dan: no alt text at all, like
no, alt property defined. When a

471
00:27:48,547 --> 00:27:50,797
screen reader is reading it,
it'll come through normal texts

472
00:27:50,826 --> 00:27:52,506
and then it'll just read like,
blah, blah, blah dot JPEG.

473
00:27:52,506 --> 00:27:54,186
Right.

474
00:27:54,707 --> 00:27:55,686
Okay. That's

475
00:27:55,721 --> 00:27:59,892
Todd: And then the, the empty
alt is silent. So that's.

476
00:27:59,961 --> 00:28:01,191
Dan: it'll that tells it to skip
right over it, which is you

477
00:28:01,191 --> 00:28:02,421
want.

478
00:28:02,422 --> 00:28:04,432
Sometimes like, sometimes that
is the preferred thing or like

479
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:06,442
the

480
00:28:06,442 --> 00:28:09,652
decorative image where it's a
background image or something

481
00:28:09,652 --> 00:28:12,832
like that, or, background, but
like, you know, sometimes it's

482
00:28:12,832 --> 00:28:14,872
just used for decoration.
Doesn't need to convey actually

483
00:28:14,872 --> 00:28:17,352
information. and so in those
cases, putting an empty, alt

484
00:28:17,352 --> 00:28:19,832
like

485
00:28:19,832 --> 00:28:24,862
alt equals, you know, empty
string. Is is actually very good

486
00:28:24,862 --> 00:28:28,521
and much like very good for
accessibility because otherwise

487
00:28:28,521 --> 00:28:32,632
they're going to see probably a
very long URL with dot JPEG,

488
00:28:32,991 --> 00:28:34,311
which means nothing to them.
Right.

489
00:28:34,382 --> 00:28:35,491
Todd: Yes. Exactly.

490
00:28:35,721 --> 00:28:38,211
Dan: Oh, that's great. Um,
that's one of those things that.

491
00:28:38,211 --> 00:28:40,701
And

492
00:28:40,701 --> 00:28:44,541
I've seen a lot of people. This
is a separate topic, like that,

493
00:28:44,541 --> 00:28:48,711
that little, like, pick that
little bit, just, just even just

494
00:28:48,711 --> 00:28:52,642
Alt getting like your head
wrapped around how to deal with

495
00:28:52,682 --> 00:28:56,932
alt, alt texts. Um, like you
said, mix can make a huge

496
00:28:56,932 --> 00:29:00,501
difference for accessibility
making a for your users. oh,

497
00:29:00,501 --> 00:29:01,132
that's really cool.

498
00:29:02,376 --> 00:29:03,636
Bekah: And you were talking
about one of the big problems

499
00:29:03,636 --> 00:29:04,896
being

500
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:09,727
color contrast. And that seems
like something that could be

501
00:29:09,727 --> 00:29:15,636
pretty simple to identify with a
Lighthouse audit. Um, can you

502
00:29:15,636 --> 00:29:18,606
explain what a Lighthouse audit
is? And if you're like, that's

503
00:29:18,606 --> 00:29:21,787
not the way to go. This other
method is better. Um, I would

504
00:29:21,787 --> 00:29:22,207
love to hear that.

505
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:26,786
Todd: So, I mean, I've used
Lighthouse before. I don't

506
00:29:26,786 --> 00:29:29,710
really

507
00:29:29,711 --> 00:29:32,186
rely on lighthouse. Lighthouse
runs off of axe-core and which

508
00:29:32,186 --> 00:29:34,661
is

509
00:29:34,662 --> 00:29:42,132
great, but I don't think it
really gets to the root of every

510
00:29:42,521 --> 00:29:49,301
issue. And it really can't. Uh,
plus you have false positives,

511
00:29:49,301 --> 00:29:52,692
which is, you know, something,
it, for example, I was just

512
00:29:52,692 --> 00:29:55,932
talking about this on the, in
the, in the Slack, uh, Virtual

513
00:29:55,932 --> 00:29:58,699
Coffee Slack. False positives
for color contrast, you know,

514
00:29:58,699 --> 00:30:01,466
I've

515
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:04,737
come across instances where it
will flag color, contrast

516
00:30:04,737 --> 00:30:08,007
errors,

517
00:30:08,007 --> 00:30:13,676
but the color contrast is far
exceeds the 4.5 to one ratio. So

518
00:30:14,126 --> 00:30:16,767
I don't really rely on
Lighthouse. I mean, it's a good

519
00:30:16,767 --> 00:30:18,701
tool. Don't get me wrong because
there's that performance piece

520
00:30:18,701 --> 00:30:20,635
to

521
00:30:20,636 --> 00:30:25,693
it that I really, really like,
uh, using and, um, As far as,

522
00:30:25,693 --> 00:30:30,750
you

523
00:30:30,751 --> 00:30:34,301
know, it's a good tool, don't
get me wrong, but I use, and I

524
00:30:34,301 --> 00:30:37,851
used

525
00:30:37,852 --> 00:30:40,432
to use it. I used to use it
myself. I mean, I used it on my

526
00:30:40,432 --> 00:30:42,801
site and was like, yeah, one
hundreds. I got one hundreds

527
00:30:42,801 --> 00:30:46,342
across the board and you know,
that, that virtual confetti

528
00:30:46,342 --> 00:30:53,471
flying everywhere. But, um, the
tools that I use would be, um,

529
00:30:56,067 --> 00:30:59,711
It's a contrast hyphen
ratio.com, which is Lea Verou,

530
00:30:59,711 --> 00:31:03,355
uh, color

531
00:31:03,356 --> 00:31:06,716
contrast site. I also use, um,
the, let me look, I have it on

532
00:31:06,716 --> 00:31:10,076
my

533
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:12,836
other machine here, the color
contrast analyzer. And that is

534
00:31:12,836 --> 00:31:15,596
by

535
00:31:15,747 --> 00:31:18,926
The Paciello Group. So Steven
Faulkner has based on the

536
00:31:18,926 --> 00:31:22,105
Windows

537
00:31:22,106 --> 00:31:24,131
version, the Mac iOS version was
developed by somebody else. Uh,

538
00:31:24,131 --> 00:31:26,156
I

539
00:31:26,156 --> 00:31:33,926
use that, that tool as well. Um,
and I will provide, uh, the link

540
00:31:33,926 --> 00:31:34,497
to that.

541
00:31:35,414 --> 00:31:37,419
Bekah: This great, I'm like
really looking forward, it could

542
00:31:37,419 --> 00:31:40,598
diving into a lot of these
resources that you are dropping

543
00:31:40,598 --> 00:31:43,043
right now. Cause I think
sometimes it's hard to know

544
00:31:43,043 --> 00:31:45,488
where

545
00:31:45,489 --> 00:31:51,068
to start. And, I think that's
just a problem with teaching

546
00:31:51,429 --> 00:31:54,413
developers in general. There's
not a focus on it. It's not

547
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:57,397
built

548
00:31:57,429 --> 00:32:07,118
into most curriculums and, um,
at all. And so there's a lack of

549
00:32:07,118 --> 00:32:11,773
focus, I think, as a result of
that. And then not knowing where

550
00:32:11,773 --> 00:32:16,114
to start, or if you're with a
company that doesn't look at

551
00:32:16,114 --> 00:32:18,668
those things, then I think it
can be, you can find yourself a

552
00:32:18,668 --> 00:32:21,222
while

553
00:32:21,223 --> 00:32:27,223
down the path and and not know
what you should be identifying,

554
00:32:27,223 --> 00:32:30,374
how you should be approaching
this. And so the more that we

555
00:32:30,374 --> 00:32:35,084
talk about it, I think the
better, um, where do you think

556
00:32:35,534 --> 00:32:39,044
people could get started if they
want to learn more about

557
00:32:39,044 --> 00:32:39,403
accessible?

558
00:32:40,094 --> 00:32:44,378
Todd: So the w three C has a
great, um, intro to

559
00:32:44,378 --> 00:32:48,662
accessibility

560
00:32:48,692 --> 00:32:52,982
class, which I believe is still
free. And yeah, it's an

561
00:32:53,042 --> 00:32:55,947
Introduction to Web
Accessibility on edex.org. And,

562
00:32:55,947 --> 00:32:58,852
uh, I took that

563
00:32:58,853 --> 00:33:01,450
class even. Um, and it was it's
great. Uh, you can pace

564
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:04,047
yourself.

565
00:33:04,528 --> 00:33:07,092
Doesn't have to be real fast is
no, you know, there's no due

566
00:33:07,092 --> 00:33:09,656
date

567
00:33:09,657 --> 00:33:11,907
or anything. There's a free
version. If you want a

568
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:17,877
certificate, you got to pay a
certain amount. Um, it's like if

569
00:33:17,877 --> 00:33:21,238
you put in four to five hours a
week, it's like for four weeks

570
00:33:21,238 --> 00:33:27,373
long, uh, to do. It gives a good
overview of, excuse me,

571
00:33:27,373 --> 00:33:30,868
accessibility, and you know,
some of the guidelines there's,

572
00:33:30,868 --> 00:33:34,363
um, a

573
00:33:34,363 --> 00:33:40,542
lot of good information on the
web, uh, and, uh, even have to

574
00:33:40,542 --> 00:33:44,532
pitch Nobility's website and
their blog. They go over some of

575
00:33:44,532 --> 00:33:50,337
the, uh, WCAG guidelines and
accessibility is also, I want to

576
00:33:50,337 --> 00:33:55,077
make this clear accessibility is
more than just WCAG guidelines.

577
00:33:55,438 --> 00:34:01,647
Um, it's also about inclusive
design as well. Um, making sure,

578
00:34:01,917 --> 00:34:07,048
you know, certain demographics
aren't, you know, kept out that,

579
00:34:07,048 --> 00:34:12,117
that everybody's included, um,
hence the name inclusive design.

580
00:34:12,447 --> 00:34:21,768
Um, but, um, Some other, um,
let's see. That's a good

581
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:24,797
question. Cause there's so much,
I mean, I guess, you know, a

582
00:34:24,797 --> 00:34:31,728
search would come up with a lot
of different things. WebAIM.org

583
00:34:31,797 --> 00:34:36,027
has some good stuff. As far as
accessibility, learning

584
00:34:36,027 --> 00:34:43,018
accessibility, um, level access
does, uh, let's see who else.

585
00:34:44,327 --> 00:34:47,310
TPGI has good stuff. So there's,
there's a lot out there that,

586
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:50,293
you

587
00:34:50,293 --> 00:34:54,913
know, people can find on, you
know, even there's even like

588
00:34:54,913 --> 00:35:00,943
courses on, I guess Udemy and
platforms like that as well.

589
00:35:03,853 --> 00:35:06,613
Bekah: So, this has kind of been
your focus the entire time

590
00:35:06,613 --> 00:35:09,373
you've

591
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:15,373
been working in tech. Was there
a reason that you went down this

592
00:35:15,373 --> 00:35:17,877
path or, or something that kind
of inspired this journey? Or

593
00:35:17,877 --> 00:35:20,381
have

594
00:35:20,382 --> 00:35:22,463
you just always been interested
in it?

595
00:35:24,333 --> 00:35:30,722
Todd: Uh, it started when a
couple of family members, I have

596
00:35:30,722 --> 00:35:36,603
like three family members that
have disabilities, um, to have

597
00:35:36,603 --> 00:35:45,012
motor skill disabilities, one
visual and. Seeing the looks of

598
00:35:45,012 --> 00:35:48,342
frustration on their faces when
they're trying to access

599
00:35:48,342 --> 00:35:52,842
something that's inaccessible on
the web really got me motivated

600
00:35:52,842 --> 00:36:01,362
in the beginning and carries me
to this day. Really. Um, I kind

601
00:36:01,362 --> 00:36:08,916
of towards like 2018, 2019 was
kind of like. I guess slacking

602
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:11,631
off a little bit with my
accessibility, but I get

603
00:36:11,631 --> 00:36:14,346
together

604
00:36:14,347 --> 00:36:17,197
with our friend, Chris DeMars in
Burlington, Vermont. There was

605
00:36:17,197 --> 00:36:20,047
a,

606
00:36:20,106 --> 00:36:27,811
there was a conference and. You
know, he gave a great talk and

607
00:36:27,992 --> 00:36:32,972
that really lit the fire again.
So there's been a really, it's

608
00:36:32,972 --> 00:36:38,911
been like laser, like focus for
me as far as, since then. And,

609
00:36:38,942 --> 00:36:41,896
um, just the looks of
frustration on faces of people

610
00:36:41,896 --> 00:36:44,850
that I've

611
00:36:44,851 --> 00:36:49,831
seen, trying to access something
that's inaccessible on the web.

612
00:36:50,461 --> 00:36:58,416
Yeah. It's just, it's very, um,
the word I'm looking for here,

613
00:36:58,956 --> 00:37:04,086
very, uh, it hits home. It
really, you know, being that I

614
00:37:04,086 --> 00:37:12,186
try to advocate for people that
don't have a voice. And, um, I

615
00:37:12,186 --> 00:37:17,452
think as, as accessibility,
professional, We all, do we try

616
00:37:17,452 --> 00:37:20,992
to advocate for those people?
Um, especially lately with

617
00:37:20,992 --> 00:37:24,532
certain, I

618
00:37:24,532 --> 00:37:28,641
will use it in quotes,
accessibility, overlays, for

619
00:37:28,641 --> 00:37:35,331
instance, but, um, yeah, that's
basically where it all started

620
00:37:35,331 --> 00:37:37,956
was just those family members
and friends and just seeing

621
00:37:37,956 --> 00:37:40,581
people,

622
00:37:40,731 --> 00:37:45,711
uh, yeah. Th the frustration and
the point where they're ready to

623
00:37:45,711 --> 00:37:46,282
give up.

624
00:37:47,967 --> 00:37:53,067
Bekah: Yeah, I, was just with
Chris last week. Um, he spoke at

625
00:37:53,336 --> 00:37:58,117
KC DC. He along with Cass Ferris
and they did anaccessibility

626
00:37:58,137 --> 00:38:00,777
talk. That was the first time I
got to see him speak in person.

627
00:38:01,422 --> 00:38:05,052
It was really great because they
both come at it with a lot of

628
00:38:05,052 --> 00:38:07,316
passion and examples. And I
think for so many of us, we have

629
00:38:07,316 --> 00:38:09,580
a

630
00:38:09,581 --> 00:38:13,001
general sense of what
accessibility is, but we don't

631
00:38:13,001 --> 00:38:18,876
have that broader sense of, uh,
you know, it might be. Um, there

632
00:38:18,876 --> 00:38:23,257
might be a disability that you
can't see, or it might be a

633
00:38:23,257 --> 00:38:25,132
temporary disability or a mental
health challenge that somebody

634
00:38:25,132 --> 00:38:27,007
is

635
00:38:27,007 --> 00:38:30,126
going through and all of those
things can impact what

636
00:38:30,126 --> 00:38:34,177
accessibility looks like. And if
you really look at the people

637
00:38:34,177 --> 00:38:39,681
around you, you for sure know
someone that has one of those

638
00:38:39,681 --> 00:38:43,492
challenges or, or you have one
yourself. And so, you know,

639
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:46,192
opening up the conversations
about this, you know, like you

640
00:38:46,192 --> 00:38:50,751
have in, in like Chris and Cass
have, I think is so important to

641
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:53,902
really making change in, in tech
overall.

642
00:38:55,661 --> 00:38:58,871
Todd: Yeah, I, you, know, you
you brought up invisible.

643
00:39:01,766 --> 00:39:06,297
Disabilities. I have migraine
headaches. Uh, I get them when

644
00:39:06,297 --> 00:39:11,306
something sets off, if there's a
website, I visit that as, you

645
00:39:11,306 --> 00:39:17,306
know, animation or motion that
really it's too much. And it's

646
00:39:17,336 --> 00:39:20,757
triggers a migraine. I mean,
there's all that stuff that you

647
00:39:20,757 --> 00:39:26,541
mentioned and. Yeah. It's, you
know, uh, Chris is great. You

648
00:39:26,541 --> 00:39:33,231
know, I, I I've seen him talk,
you know, virtually and then

649
00:39:33,831 --> 00:39:37,132
before the pandemic and
everything, and we've gotten to

650
00:39:37,132 --> 00:39:39,306
know each other and he, you
know, he does a great job

651
00:39:39,306 --> 00:39:41,480
advocating.

652
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,369
Bekah: yeah. I think, you know,
even so a couple of years ago I

653
00:39:44,369 --> 00:39:48,090
was diagnosed with ADHD and it's
interesting how much I didn't

654
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:50,370
realize that impacts the things
that I interact with and the

655
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:52,650
ways

656
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:56,965
that I interact with things.
Maybe this is just a personal

657
00:39:56,965 --> 00:39:59,905
problem, but this is the
conversation between Discord and

658
00:39:59,905 --> 00:40:04,135
Slack. For me, like I walk into
Discord, I don't walk in there.

659
00:40:04,494 --> 00:40:06,684
Um, I open up Discord and it's
immediately just overwhelming

660
00:40:06,684 --> 00:40:08,874
and

661
00:40:08,875 --> 00:40:11,514
I don't know where to go from
there. And then I just like

662
00:40:11,844 --> 00:40:15,655
slowly back out the door, right?
Like there's too much going on

663
00:40:15,655 --> 00:40:16,135
for me.

664
00:40:16,356 --> 00:40:19,657
Todd: Yeah. That information
overload happens to me as well.

665
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:28,811
Um, it's like Slack and, uh,
Discord and. There's yeah, I was

666
00:40:28,811 --> 00:40:32,171
on, I was watching a, uh, Twitch
stream yesterday and the chat

667
00:40:32,171 --> 00:40:35,531
was

668
00:40:35,532 --> 00:40:39,882
going off and I was just like, I
just, I can't, I want to be able

669
00:40:39,882 --> 00:40:44,112
to kind of read the chat and I
can't because you know it, yeah.

670
00:40:44,121 --> 00:40:46,481
The information overload is a
big thing too.

671
00:40:47,889 --> 00:40:52,929
Bekah: So I, you know, I think,
um, Your background, you talked

672
00:40:52,929 --> 00:40:57,400
about your journey through this
and it seems like you've been

673
00:40:57,429 --> 00:40:59,679
mostly self-taught then, is that
right?

674
00:41:00,586 --> 00:41:03,248
Todd: Yeah. Um, I started, when
I picked up that Commodore 64

675
00:41:03,248 --> 00:41:05,910
user

676
00:41:05,911 --> 00:41:09,841
manual. And just, I love to read
and I read that I had purchased

677
00:41:09,841 --> 00:41:13,771
a

678
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:17,821
book. It was a Learn HTML in 21
days. And it was like a big,

679
00:41:17,821 --> 00:41:21,871
huge

680
00:41:21,902 --> 00:41:26,851
thick phone book, like manual.
And I read through that. That's

681
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:33,242
how I actually made my first
website. Uh, not that I put it

682
00:41:33,242 --> 00:41:39,632
out on the web or anything, but
then I. Um, I graduated from

683
00:41:39,632 --> 00:41:41,761
there on, I went to Geo Cities
and Angel Fire and Tripod and

684
00:41:41,761 --> 00:41:43,890
all

685
00:41:43,891 --> 00:41:46,922
those websites, if you remember
those websites

686
00:41:46,942 --> 00:41:47,612
Dan: here. Yeah.

687
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:52,411
Todd: and all the great, you
know, lime green and pastel and,

688
00:41:52,742 --> 00:41:56,559
you know, fluorescent colors.
Um, and then, you know, It's

689
00:41:56,559 --> 00:42:00,376
been a

690
00:42:00,376 --> 00:42:04,847
learning process the entire time
and I love to learn. So it's one

691
00:42:04,847 --> 00:42:07,456
of those things where if I can
pick up something in a Slack

692
00:42:07,876 --> 00:42:13,427
group or on a Discord channel,
that's great. I've, you know, I

693
00:42:13,427 --> 00:42:19,947
keep learning every day and, you
know, learning. Lately it's been

694
00:42:19,947 --> 00:42:23,936
learning the intricacies of the
WCAG guidelines because there's

695
00:42:23,936 --> 00:42:26,756
so much there. Um, and being
able to, and I'm grateful for

696
00:42:26,756 --> 00:42:29,576
this

697
00:42:29,606 --> 00:42:36,177
being able to work on the next,
I guess, version, which is 3.0,

698
00:42:36,987 --> 00:42:41,097
which is a few years down the
road has been a learning process

699
00:42:41,097 --> 00:42:43,091
as well. And being a member of
the W3C is to, and being in

700
00:42:43,091 --> 00:42:45,085
those

701
00:42:45,086 --> 00:42:49,902
meetings and. We're learning so
much from a great group of

702
00:42:49,902 --> 00:42:50,322
people.

703
00:42:50,942 --> 00:42:52,547
Bekah: Yeah, that's awesome. I
love that idea of just

704
00:42:52,547 --> 00:42:54,152
consistent

705
00:42:54,152 --> 00:42:55,636
learning and being open to
learning all of the time,

706
00:42:55,636 --> 00:42:57,120
because

707
00:42:57,121 --> 00:43:02,161
I think no matter what part of
tech or, or any industry really

708
00:43:02,161 --> 00:43:05,612
that you're in the being open to
learning new things and talking

709
00:43:05,612 --> 00:43:07,697
through things with other
people. and understanding is,

710
00:43:07,697 --> 00:43:09,782
you know,

711
00:43:09,782 --> 00:43:14,251
that that's what growing is
about. That's what is important

712
00:43:14,251 --> 00:43:14,882
to what you're doing.

713
00:43:18,112 --> 00:43:23,001
Todd: Yeah. It's, you know, even
I've, you know, learned, I

714
00:43:23,001 --> 00:43:26,722
learned on Twitter as well, you
know, I see something, a link to

715
00:43:26,722 --> 00:43:30,262
an article or something and I
check it out and it's like, oh,

716
00:43:30,291 --> 00:43:37,981
well, you know, Today I learned,
you know, and you know, I it's

717
00:43:38,041 --> 00:43:40,591
it's, you know, there was a
quote and I'll try to find that

718
00:43:40,591 --> 00:43:43,141
quote

719
00:43:43,172 --> 00:43:49,532
because I love the quote. Um, it
had something to do with, uh,

720
00:43:49,652 --> 00:43:57,601
doing something. Yeah, right
there. Um, there are three

721
00:43:57,601 --> 00:44:03,976
things. Everyone should do every
day. Number one is laugh. Number

722
00:44:03,976 --> 00:44:09,407
two is think, spend some time in
thought number three, you should

723
00:44:09,407 --> 00:44:11,221
have your emotions, you to
tears. If you laugh, think and

724
00:44:11,221 --> 00:44:13,035
cry,

725
00:44:13,036 --> 00:44:17,476
that's a heck of a day. And that
was just like the best quote. I

726
00:44:17,476 --> 00:44:21,916
think I've seen it in a long,
long time. I even add to that

727
00:44:21,916 --> 00:44:23,137
learning one thing a day.

728
00:44:23,873 --> 00:44:27,838
Bekah: Yeah. I love that so
much. I didn't think, you know,

729
00:44:27,869 --> 00:44:30,133
learning things on Twitter for
me has been really big as well.

730
00:44:30,133 --> 00:44:32,397
Even

731
00:44:32,398 --> 00:44:36,239
when somebody just has a small
portion of a tweet at, for some

732
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:39,329
reason, it sticks in my mind
better than if I read a whole

733
00:44:39,329 --> 00:44:42,418
article on that thing. And I
think maybe because there's some

734
00:44:42,418 --> 00:44:44,278
type of personal connection
there. Oh, I remember that

735
00:44:44,278 --> 00:44:46,138
person

736
00:44:46,139 --> 00:44:48,929
said this one thing and it, you
know, it might be some type of

737
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:53,338
coding tip or whatever, but I
think that just be just sharing

738
00:44:53,338 --> 00:44:57,568
that knowledge or, or it's Hey,
I know that I could ask that

739
00:44:57,568 --> 00:45:02,849
person. That question can be
really helpful in finding the

740
00:45:02,849 --> 00:45:07,768
answers to things or having more
confidence in, in being, being

741
00:45:07,798 --> 00:45:09,298
able to ask questions.

742
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:17,648
Todd: Yeah. It's it's, you know,
I use Twitter as a tool to say,

743
00:45:18,699 --> 00:45:22,358
you know, oh, you, you mentioned
something about the new, you

744
00:45:22,358 --> 00:45:25,388
know, um, whatever coming,
coming down the line. I've got a

745
00:45:25,388 --> 00:45:28,418
couple

746
00:45:28,418 --> 00:45:33,349
of questions for you. Um, you
know, Hey, can I, you know, DM

747
00:45:33,349 --> 00:45:36,998
you, I got a question I need to
ask and it reaching out to

748
00:45:36,998 --> 00:45:40,869
somebody to, or to the person
that, you know, had that tweet

749
00:45:41,259 --> 00:45:44,243
it's, uh, and, and Mo you know,
I don't think I've ever had

750
00:45:44,243 --> 00:45:47,227
anybody

751
00:45:47,228 --> 00:45:48,743
go no I don't want to tell you
the answer or anything like

752
00:45:48,743 --> 00:45:50,258
that.

753
00:45:50,438 --> 00:45:55,418
So, um, yeah, it's, uh, it's
always been, you know, Hey, you

754
00:45:55,418 --> 00:46:00,074
know, I've got this question.
People are more than, you know,

755
00:46:00,943 --> 00:46:04,304
more than welcome to, to answer
those questions.

756
00:46:05,634 --> 00:46:07,943
Bekah: Yeah. And I think that's
so big, especially when we're

757
00:46:07,943 --> 00:46:11,244
talking about this topic. If you
don't know it is okay to ask

758
00:46:11,244 --> 00:46:13,208
somebody, Or ask someone just to
direct you, you know, I'm

759
00:46:13,208 --> 00:46:15,172
getting

760
00:46:15,173 --> 00:46:17,003
started in this. It's not been a
focus. How, how do I get

761
00:46:17,003 --> 00:46:18,833
started?

762
00:46:18,833 --> 00:46:20,798
What do I do? And dropped a lot
of great resources here, but,

763
00:46:20,798 --> 00:46:22,763
you

764
00:46:22,764 --> 00:46:26,333
know, I think in, in every place
and space we should, we should

765
00:46:26,333 --> 00:46:27,893
know that it is okay to ask
about these things. And it's

766
00:46:27,893 --> 00:46:29,453
good to do

767
00:46:29,454 --> 00:46:29,813
that.

768
00:46:30,429 --> 00:46:32,393
Todd: Yeah, definitely. You
know, I tell people, you know,

769
00:46:32,393 --> 00:46:34,357
if you

770
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:35,738
have a question about
accessibility, I'll do my best

771
00:46:35,738 --> 00:46:37,118
to

772
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:38,903
answer. If I can't answer it, I
will find somebody that can, or

773
00:46:38,903 --> 00:46:40,687
I

774
00:46:40,688 --> 00:46:42,103
will look it up and see if I can
get you the answer, because

775
00:46:42,103 --> 00:46:43,518
it's,

776
00:46:43,518 --> 00:46:45,490
it's, it's that little, you
know, it's that being helpful?

777
00:46:45,490 --> 00:46:47,462
And

778
00:46:47,463 --> 00:46:50,364
again, making, you know, making
sure that person has that

779
00:46:50,364 --> 00:46:54,594
information for me anyways, is,
is big. And, you know, just

780
00:46:54,594 --> 00:46:57,684
saying, you know, feeling good
about being able to help people.

781
00:46:59,293 --> 00:47:01,364
Bekah: Yeah, for sure. That's so
important.

782
00:47:01,364 --> 00:47:02,224
Dan: I love it.

783
00:47:03,773 --> 00:47:06,818
Bekah: we have about one a time
for one more question. And, and

784
00:47:06,818 --> 00:47:07,958
I'd love to hear what you have
to say about this. Cause I know

785
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:09,098
that

786
00:47:09,099 --> 00:47:12,699
there still are companies out
there that are, um, have some

787
00:47:12,699 --> 00:47:18,398
pushback about paying for making
things accessible, or they say

788
00:47:18,398 --> 00:47:20,588
like, well, that's not our focus
right now because we don't have

789
00:47:20,588 --> 00:47:22,628
the time or the money to do
that. How would you that

790
00:47:22,628 --> 00:47:24,668
situation? Or,

791
00:47:24,818 --> 00:47:26,228
you know, maybe if you were a
developer consulting on that,

792
00:47:26,228 --> 00:47:27,638
you

793
00:47:27,639 --> 00:47:30,398
know, how would you kind of
convince them that this, this

794
00:47:30,398 --> 00:47:31,179
should be a priority?

795
00:47:31,643 --> 00:47:36,463
Todd: Okay. Funny. You mentioned
that. Cause I wrote a article,

796
00:47:36,824 --> 00:47:42,164
uh, about that and it's on
smashing magazine. So I'll get

797
00:47:42,164 --> 00:47:46,981
that. Link to you as well. It's
a very tricky slope sometimes.

798
00:47:46,981 --> 00:47:51,798
Um,

799
00:47:51,858 --> 00:47:55,608
you know, I've heard people for
instance say, well, you don't

800
00:47:55,608 --> 00:48:00,534
want to get sued. And that kind
of. Perks up stakeholders ears

801
00:48:00,534 --> 00:48:03,353
and says, oh, you know, well, I
guess we're going to have to do

802
00:48:03,353 --> 00:48:14,934
this me. I use real world
examples of, for instance, I ran

803
00:48:14,934 --> 00:48:21,083
into a stakeholder on a project
and I said, we've got to make

804
00:48:21,083 --> 00:48:24,054
sure accessibility is done from
the very beginning of the

805
00:48:24,054 --> 00:48:27,773
project. He turned to me and
said, we don't have disabled

806
00:48:27,773 --> 00:48:30,503
users. I in turn said to him,
you're wearing eyeglasses,

807
00:48:30,503 --> 00:48:33,233
that's

808
00:48:33,233 --> 00:48:38,454
an assistive technology and he
kind of perked up, but I'd,

809
00:48:38,454 --> 00:48:40,928
hadn't convinced him. So the,
you know, there's some people

810
00:48:40,928 --> 00:48:43,402
that

811
00:48:43,403 --> 00:48:47,934
can be very stubborn. So I went
as far as to say, you know,

812
00:48:48,534 --> 00:48:50,754
somebody's working. You know,
using your product, they can

813
00:48:50,754 --> 00:48:52,974
have

814
00:48:52,974 --> 00:48:55,554
a broken arm, it could be a
situational disability. They

815
00:48:55,563 --> 00:48:58,224
could have a broken arm. They
could be at home working with a

816
00:48:58,224 --> 00:49:02,094
child on their lap. That's very
fussy. I've been there a long

817
00:49:02,094 --> 00:49:05,403
time ago. I know that feeling
and I, you know, I know Bekah,

818
00:49:05,403 --> 00:49:08,712
you're

819
00:49:08,713 --> 00:49:10,753
a parent. I don't know if you're
a parent, Dan, but.

820
00:49:10,853 --> 00:49:11,253
Dan: yeah.

821
00:49:11,753 --> 00:49:15,264
Todd: Yeah. Yeah. So you both
know that, you know, you have a

822
00:49:15,264 --> 00:49:18,563
child on your lap and they're
fussy, you know, and you're

823
00:49:18,563 --> 00:49:22,164
trying to answer an email or
something. It's very difficult.

824
00:49:22,164 --> 00:49:26,408
So, you know, getting teams on
board is another thing too,

825
00:49:26,408 --> 00:49:30,652
where

826
00:49:30,684 --> 00:49:35,918
getting somebody. A person
dedicated to doing accessibility

827
00:49:35,918 --> 00:49:39,338
on the design side, on the
development side, on the

828
00:49:39,338 --> 00:49:45,009
marketing side. That helps too.
But the main thing is getting

829
00:49:45,009 --> 00:49:47,604
stakeholders on board. If you
can get a stakeholder on board,

830
00:49:47,604 --> 00:49:50,199
then

831
00:49:50,318 --> 00:49:52,703
it should be much, much easier
to get the entire organization

832
00:49:52,703 --> 00:49:55,088
on

833
00:49:55,088 --> 00:49:55,498
board.

834
00:49:57,268 --> 00:49:58,433
Bekah: Yeah, that's great. I
love that. You know, it all

835
00:49:58,433 --> 00:49:59,598
comes down

836
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:03,228
to listening and being
open-minded right. If we work

837
00:50:03,228 --> 00:50:05,238
towards understanding each
other, then we can all do a

838
00:50:05,238 --> 00:50:07,248
whole lot

839
00:50:07,248 --> 00:50:09,139
more to improve things for
everyone.

840
00:50:10,478 --> 00:50:15,188
Todd: Yeah, definitely.
Definitely. Yep. I've heard it,

841
00:50:15,998 --> 00:50:19,268
I've heard it before. We don't
have the budget, you know, we'll

842
00:50:19,268 --> 00:50:26,418
get to it after launch. Well,
that brings me back to. Yep. If

843
00:50:26,418 --> 00:50:28,998
you do everything from the
beginning, you will have the

844
00:50:28,998 --> 00:50:33,108
money for it and you know, it
will be less stressed, so, yeah.

845
00:50:33,148 --> 00:50:35,188
Dan: don't need to pay for it.
Find the budget to pay for a

846
00:50:35,188 --> 00:50:38,454
whole round of. You know,
auditing and stuff.

847
00:50:39,208 --> 00:50:45,298
Todd: Right. Yeah. And auditing.
So I'll use an example of a

848
00:50:45,298 --> 00:50:53,664
company that got sued and what
they could have. What they could

849
00:50:53,664 --> 00:50:55,643
have spent just with, you know,
doing it from the beginning,

850
00:50:55,643 --> 00:50:57,622
they

851
00:50:57,623 --> 00:51:00,713
ended up paying seven figures
for an audit. So that should

852
00:51:00,713 --> 00:51:03,803
tell you

853
00:51:03,804 --> 00:51:05,634
something about that process.

854
00:51:06,099 --> 00:51:07,149
Bekah: Right. And it shouldn't
ever have to come to that.

855
00:51:07,149 --> 00:51:08,199
That's

856
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:10,989
know, absolutely ridiculous,

857
00:51:11,494 --> 00:51:11,793
Todd: yeah.

858
00:51:12,728 --> 00:51:14,768
Bekah: But I'm so glad that you
were here today to talk us

859
00:51:14,768 --> 00:51:17,228
through this and drop all of
these great resources. And I

860
00:51:17,228 --> 00:51:19,283
really hope that, you know, it
helps people who are listening

861
00:51:19,283 --> 00:51:21,338

862
00:51:22,059 --> 00:51:24,878
work through the stuff. And to
know that it's okay to ask

863
00:51:24,878 --> 00:51:30,233
questions. And to Grow and learn
more all the time. Um, so we'll

864
00:51:30,233 --> 00:51:33,563
make sure that we drop all those
links in the show notes. And
